  "description": "The Cancer Data Service (CDS) is one of several data commons within the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC). CDS provides data storage and sharing capabilities for NCI-funded studies. It currently hosts a variety of data types from NCI projects such as the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI), and data from independent research projects. The CDS is home to both open and controlled access data, but the CDS Portal is accessible for users to search and browse with no login. Users can see if the CDS has data of interest before requesting access.",
