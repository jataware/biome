name: INDRA Context Graph Extension (CoGEx)
description: >
    INDRA CoGEx (Context Graph Extension) is an automatically assembled biomedical knowledge graph which integrates causal mechanisms from INDRA 
    with non-causal contextual relations including properties, ontology, and data. 

    The INDRA CoGEx Query API is a RESTful service designed to streamline complex queries within the biomedical domain, 
    powered by the Contextual Graph Explorer (CoGEx) framework. It provides an interface to retrieve detailed insights 
    by integrating and analyzing data from diverse biomedical sources. Users can execute queries to uncover relationships 
    such as diseases associated with specific clinical trials, drugs linked to particular side effects, or other intricate 
    connections in biomedical knowledge. By leveraging its contextual graph-based approach, the API enables researchers, 
    data scientists, and healthcare professionals to explore and analyze rich biomedical data efficiently, supporting 
    advancements in drug discovery, clinical decision-making, and research. With its robust architecture, the INDRA CoGEx 
    Query API facilitates the discovery of meaningful patterns and supports informed decision-making in complex biomedical scenarios.
