    # Cancer Data Aggregator
    The Cancer Data Aggregator (CDA) is a service of the National Cancer Institutes' (NCI) Cancer Research Data Commons. We pull metadata for thousands of studies hosted at multiple data repositories across NCI, and make it available for search from a single tool so researchers can more easily find and reuse existing cancer research data. In between pulling and publishing, we thoroughly clean, harmonize, and cross-reference the metadata so you can easily do things like find subjects that have participated in multiple studies, discover data from a disease that was originally described in different ways at each repository, and compile all the data from your favorite program such as CPTAC - no matter where it ended up. 

    # Conceptual Overview
    You can think of the CDA as a really, really enormous spreadsheet full of data. To search this enormous spreadsheet, you'd want to select columns that have data you're interested in, and then filter the rows to only the values you care about. 

    CDA data comes from six sources:
    - The Proteomic Data Commons (PDC)
    - The Genomic Data Commons (GDC)
    - The Imaging Data Commons (IDC)
    - The Cancer Data Service (CDS)
    - The Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC)
    - The ISB Cancer Gateway in the Cloud (ISB-CGC)

    The CDA makes this data searchable in five main endpoints:
    - subject: A patient entity captures the study-independent metadata for research subjects. Human research subjects are usually not traceable to a particular person to protect the subjects privacy.
    - researchsubject: A research subject is the entity of interest in a specific research study or project, typically a human being or an animal, but can also be a device, group of humans or animals, or a tissue sample. Human research subjects are usually not traceable to a particular person to protect the subjects privacy. This entity plays the role of the case_id in existing data. A subject who participates in 3 studies will have 3 researchsubject IDs.
    - specimen: Any material taken as a sample from a biological entity (living or dead), or from a physical object or the environment. Specimens are usually collected as an example of their kind, often for use in some investigation.
    - mutation: Molecular data about specific mutations, currently limited to the TCGA-READ project from GDC.
    - file: A unit of data about subjects, researchsubjects, specimens, or their associated information.

    and two endpoints that offer deeper information about data in the researchsubject endpoint:
    - diagnosis: A collection of characteristics that describe an abnormal condition of the body as assessed at a point in time. May be used to capture information about neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions.
    - treatment: Represent medication administration or other treatment types.

    If the CDA works like a giant spreadsheet, the endpoints are sets of specific columns that always go together. Any metadata field can be searched from any endpoint, the only difference between search types is what type of data is returned by default.

    If you are looking to build a cohort of distinct individuals who meet some criteria, you would search by subject, and the result will be a table of information with one row per subject. If you are looking for biosamples that can be ordered or a specific format of information (e.g. histological slides) start with specimen. This search will return a table of information with one row per biosample. If you want to build a cohort, but are particularly interested in studies rather than the participants, search by researchsubject. 

    # Data Sources
    ## Genomics Data Commons    
    The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) is a cancer knowledge network that supports hosting, standardization, and analysis of genomic, clinical, and biospecimen data from cancer research programs. The GDC harmonizes raw sequencing data, identifies and applies state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods for generating mutation calls, structural variants and other high-level data, and provides scalable downloads and web-based analysis tools. Because of the personal nature of genomic data, some genomic data in the GDC may be controlled access, requiring eRA Commons authentication and dbGaP authorization to access the data.

    ## Proteomic Data Commons
    The Proteomic Data Commons (PDC) was developed to advance understanding of how proteins help to shape the risk, diagnosis, development, progression, and treatment of cancer. In-depth analysis of proteomic data allows the study of both how and why cancer develops and informs ways of tailoring treatment for individual patients using precision medicine. All proteomic data in the PDC are open access and, with appropriate attribution, can be included in publications.

    ## Imaging Data Commons
    NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC) is a cloud-based repository of publicly available cancer imaging data co-located with the analysis and exploration tools and resources. IDC is a node within the broader NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) infrastructure that provides secure access to a large, comprehensive, and expanding collection of cancer research data.

    All data hosted by IDC is available publicly. The current content of IDC is populated using the radiology collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), as well as data collected by other major NCI initiatives, such as TCGA, CPTAC, NLST and HTAN. IDC does not perform de-identification of images but accepts data de-identified by TCIA or other Data Coordinating Centers that are approved by NCI Security.

    ## Cancer Data Services
    The CDS provides data storage and sharing capabilities for NCI-funded studies that fall under the following categories: • Studies with data that do not match an existing CRDC data commons • Studies with data that do not fit current data type criteria and/or the minimum metadata standards for a CRDC data commons.

    CDS currently hosts a variety of data types from NCI projects such as the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), and Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) as well as data from independent research projects. The CDS is home to both open and controlled access data.

    ## Integrated Canine Data Commons
    The Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC) is a cloud-based repository of spontaneously-arising canine cancer data. ICDC was established to further research on human cancers by enabling comparative analysis with canine cancer. The data in the ICDC is sourced from multiple different programs and projects; all focused on canine subjects. The data is harmonized into an integrated data model and then made available to the research community.

    ## ISB Cancer Gateway in the Cloud
    The ISB Cancer Gateway in the Cloud (ISB-CGC) is one of three National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cloud Resources tasked with enabling researchers to combine cancer data and cloud computation. The ISB-CGC cloud resource hosts data from a variety of sources such as HTAN and TCGA, CPTAC, and TARGET from the GDC and PDC in Google BigQuery columnar data tables. This includes file, case, clinical, and open access derived data that can be accessed both programmatically and through interactive web applications, eliminating the need to download and store large data sets.

    ## Data Standards Services (DSS)
    The DSS provides us with harmonized values mapped to the data sources above. In our current release, DSS has provided values for: ethnicity, file_format, morphology, primary_diagnosis, race, species, therapeutic_agent, source_material_type (cancer/normal), treatment_type, and vital_status.

    Typically metadata retrieved from CDA will locate the raw data files via Data Repository Service (DRS) URIs.
    DRS URIs are not to the data itself, but will return metadata about the location of the data.
    The location metadata (which should include the actual data download URL) can be retrieved by using the drs_uri_info tool if it is available,
    or by querying "https://nci-crdc.datacommons.io/ga4gh/drs/v1/objects/<object_id>" directly.

    All data in CDA should be publicly accessible without any special permissions or credentials.

    You should make use of the python requests library to interact with the API.
    Note that the base URL of the API is 'https://cda.datacommons.cancer.gov/'

    Here are some examples of how to use the API:
