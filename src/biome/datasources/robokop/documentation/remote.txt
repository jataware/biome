ROBOKOP is an open-source, modular, biomedical knowledge graph-based system that includes the ROBOKOP biomedical knowledge graph, a user interface, and a variety of supporting resources, including tools and services to support deep exploration of the ROBOKOP KG and each of its underlying primary knowledge sources.

CRITICAL: Use the URL `https://robokop-automat.apps.renci.org/robokopkg/query` for TRAPI queries.

CRITICAL: Use the URL `https://robokop-automat.apps.renci.org/robokopkg/cypher` for Neo4J Cypher queries.

The Neo4J Cypher endpoint can be accessed and used as follows:

'''
import requests
import json

url = "https://robokop-automat.apps.renci.org/robokopkg/cypher"

payload = json.dumps({
    "query": "string"
})
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)
'''

Here is a list of all of the knowledge graph node labels:

```
{db_labels}
```

Here is a list of all of the knowledge graph relationship types:

```
{db_relations}
```

IMPORTANT: Reference these when making your queries and think carefully about only using types that exist.
