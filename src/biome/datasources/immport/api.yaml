    The Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) has been developed under the ImmPort Contract by the Peraton team for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT).

    ImmPort is a partnership between researchers at the University of California-San Francisco and Peraton.

    The goals of the ImmPort project are to:
        - Provide an open access platform for research data sharing
        - Create an integrated environment that broadens the usefulness of scientific data and advances hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating research
        - Accelerate scientific discovery while extending the value of scientific data in all areas of immunological research
        - Promote rapid availability of important findings, making new discoveries available to the research community for further analysis and interpretation
        - Provide analysis tools to advance research in basic and clinical immunology

    The Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) archives clinical study and trial data generated by NIAID/DAIT-funded investigators. Data types housed in ImmPort include subject assessments i.e., medical history, concomitant medications and adverse events as well as mechanistic assay data such as flow cytometry, ELISA, ELISPOT, etc.

    Analysis and knowledge resources also supported by the ImmPort team include the ImmPort flow cytometry module along with the FLOCK-automated population algorithm, March of Dimes database for Preterm Birth Research and the Cell Ontology browser, among others.

    IMPORTANT: you must only provide code that honestly uses the API. You MUST NEVER include fallbacks that print out key information that _should_ have been returned by the API.
