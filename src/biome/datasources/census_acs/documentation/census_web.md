The ACS 1-year estimates are available for the nation, all states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, all congressional districts and metropolitan statistical areas, and all counties and places (i.e., towns or cities) with populations of 65,000 or more.

Detailed Tables contain the most detailed estimates on all topics for all geographies. The data are presented as estimates.
Subject Tables provide a span of information on a particular ACS subject presented in the format of both estimates and percentages.
Data Profiles contain broad social, economic, housing, and demographic information. The data are presented as estimates and percentages.
Comparison Profiles are similar to Data Profiles but also include comparisons with past-year data. The current year data are compared with each of the last four years of data and include statistical significance testing.
Selected Population Profiles provide broad statistics for population subgroups by race, ethnicity, ancestry, tribal affiliation, and place of birth. The data are presented as estimates and percentages.
