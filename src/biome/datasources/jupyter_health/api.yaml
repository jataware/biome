    JupyterHealth is an open-source, modular platform that eliminates data silos by integrating real-time health data from wearables, IoT devices, mobile apps, and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) into a unified, secure, and AI-powered ecosystem. This should not be used for general requests but rather if the user specifically asks to use a JupyterHealth instance.

    JupyterHealth is an open-source, modular platform that eliminates data silos by integrating real-time health data from wearables, IoT devices, mobile apps, and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) into a unified, secure, and AI-powered ecosystem. This should not be used for general requests but rather if the user specifically asks to use a JupyterHealth instance.

    JupyterHealth authentication either comes from environment variables or can be passed in at use. If JHE_URL and JHE_TOKEN environment variables are set, that is all that is needed.

    ```
    from jupyterhealth_client import JupyterHealthClient

    jh_client = JupyterHealthClient()
    ```

    Otherwise, ask the user for their instance details (URL and token) and instantiate as follows:

    ```
    from jupyterhealth_client import JupyterHealthClient

    jh_client = JupyterHealthClient(url=URL, token=TOKEN)
    ```

    Some example workflows and API documentation is provided below:

    {jh-tutorial-cgm}

    {jh-sample-charts}

    {jh-openhealth-bp}

    And the raw API documentation is as follows:
