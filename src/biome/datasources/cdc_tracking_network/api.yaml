    The Tracking Program collects, integrates, analyzes, and disseminates non-infectious disease, 
    environmental, and socio-economic data from various sources. 
    These include a collective of national, state, and local partners.

    This is an HTTP API, where the usage is free but rate-limiting is applied heavily when not using an API KEY.
    You will need an API Key. It is available in the environment variable:
    - apiToken: os.environ.get("API_CDC_TRACKING_NETWORK")

    To fully understand specifics about what data is or is not available, 
    you must run code against the API to see what features are available at
    what level of geography.
