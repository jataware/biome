name: Netrias Harmonization API
integration_type: api

description: |
    The Netrias Harmonization REST API leverages AI-driven harmonization approaches to standardize
    cancer-related terminologies from the Cancer Data Service (CDS), managed by the Center for
    Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT) at NIH.

    This API is designed to process and harmonize textual variations of terms, mapping them to
    standardized terms defined in the CDS data model ontology (version 5.0.5). By utilizing
    advanced machine learning techniques, the service enhances data consistency, improves
    interoperability, and streamlines standardization for cancer research and biomedical
    informatics applications.

    The API enables automated term reconciliation, ensuring uniform terminology across datasets
    for more reliable data integration and analysis. The current intended application is for
    harmonization of terms in study metadata from cancer researchers delivering research data
    to the Cancer Research Data Commons.

    # Additional Instructions:

    The REST API is accessible at https://apieval.netriaslabs.cloud/.
    It uses API Keys to track access. It is just applied as an additional HTTP header `x-api-key: <KEY>`

    **IMPORTANT**: the API Key is available in the environment variable `NETRIAS_KEY`.

    For CDS standard terms, commonly referred to as Common Data Elements or CDEs, with large numbers of permissible values,
    Netrias builds fine tuned LLMs from synthetically generated training data. If a CDE has a small number of permissible values,
    we apply in-context learning approaches where we craft a prompt to feed an LLM API chat endpoint (e.g. OpenAI) requesting it
    generate harmonizations with no or few examples. When used as a tool, this may lead to significant variations in response
    latency as the fine tuned models may take some time to load into a GPU, tokenize the input, and infer the intended response.

    The REST API also supports the harmonization of terms from ontologies supporting Sage Bionetworks' data repositories focused
    on rare diseases and cancers. In a demonstration integration of the API with Sage's Synapse chatbot application the teams
    focused on four types of variations. Here are some examples:

    1. Typos
        a. neurofibromatisis type ! → Neurofibromatosis type 1
        b. whole exme squencing → whole exome sequencing

    2. Exact synonyms
        a. NF-1 → Neurofibromatosis type 1
        b. WEX → whole exome sequencing

    3. Narrow synonyms
        a. Watson Syndrome → Neurofibromatosis type 1
        b. clinical whole-exome sequencing → whole exome sequencing

    4. Broad synonyms
        a. NF → Neurofibromatosis type 1
        b. DNA sequencing → whole exome sequencing
