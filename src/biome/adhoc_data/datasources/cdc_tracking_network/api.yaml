    The Tracking Program collects, integrates, analyzes, and disseminates non-infectious disease,
    environmental, and socio-economic data from various sources.
    These include a collective of national, state, and local partners.

    This is an HTTP API, where the usage is free but rate-limiting is applied heavily when not using an API KEY.
    You will need an API Key. It is available in the environment variable:
    - apiToken: os.environ.get("API_CDC_TRACKING_NETWORK")

    To fully understand specifics about what data is or is not available,
    you must run code against the API to see what features are available at
    what level of geography.

    Never simulate this API- if it is not available ask the user how to proceed.
