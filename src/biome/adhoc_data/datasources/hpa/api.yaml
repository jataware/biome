description: |
    The Human Protein Atlas is a Swedish-based program initiated in 2003 with the aim to map all
    the human proteins in cells, tissues, and organs using an integration of various omics
    technologies, including antibody-based imaging, mass spectrometry-based proteomics,
    transcriptomics, and systems biology. All the data in the knowledge resource is open access
    to allow scientists both in academia and industry to freely access the data for exploration
    of the human proteome.

    The Human Protein Atlas consists of eight separate resources, each focusing on a particular
    aspect of the genome-wide analysis of the human proteins:

    - The Tissue resource, showing the distribution of the proteins across all major tissues and
      organs in the human body
    - The Brain resource, exploring the distribution of proteins in various regions of the
      mammalian brain
    - The Single Cell resource, showing expression of protein-coding genes in immune cells and
      human single cell types based on bulk and single cell RNA-seq
    - The Subcellular resource, showing the subcellular localization of proteins in single cells
    - The Cancer resource, showing the impact of protein levels for the survival of patients
      with cancer
    - The Blood resource, describing proteins detected in blood and showing protein levels in
      blood in patients with different diseases
    - The Cell line resource, showing expression of protein-coding genes in human cancer cell
      lines
    - The Structure & Interaction resource, showing predicted 3D structures and exploring
      protein-coding genes in the context of protein-protein and metabolic interaction networks.

    The Human Protein Atlas program has already contributed to several thousands of publications
    in the field of human biology and disease and is selected by the organization ELIXIR as a
    European core resource due to its fundamental importance for a wider life science community.
    In addition the Human Protein Atlas has been appointed Global Core Biodata Resource (GCBR)
    by the Global Biodata Coalition. The Human Protein Atlas consortium is mainly funded by the
    Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.
