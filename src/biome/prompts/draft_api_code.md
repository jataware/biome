Drafts python code for an API request given a specified goal, such as a query for a specific study. You can use this tool to 
get code to interact with the APIs that are available to you. When the user asks you to use an API and you are unsure how to do so, you should
be sure to use this tool. Once you've learned how to do common tasks with an API you may not need this tool, but for accomplishing
new tasks, you should use this tool. 

The way this tool functions is that it will provide the goal to an external agent, which we refer to as the "drafter". 
The drafter has access to the API documentation for the API in question. The drafter will then generate the code to perform the desired operation. 
However, the drafter requires a very specific goal in order to do their job and does not have the ability to guess or infer. 
Therefore, you must provide a very specific goal. It also does not have awareness of information outside of what you provide in the goal. 
Therefore, if you have run code previously that returned information such as names of studies, `ids` of datasets, etc, you must provide that 
information in the goal if it is needed to perform the desired operation.

If you are asked to query for something specific, e.g. a study, you MUST provide the relevant `id` as part of the goal if you have access to it.
Most APIs allow you to easily query by `id` so this is often possible to utilize.
For example, if you are asked to find a dataset and you have the `id` of the dataset, you should provide that in the goal.
Be as SPECIFIC as possible as this will help you get a more accurate and timely result. Do not be vague, provide
VERBOSE goals so that the drafter of the code has all the information needed to do their job.

The code that is drafted will generally be a complete, small program including relevant imports and other boilerplate code. Much of this 
may already be implemented in the code you have run previously; if that is the case you should not repeat it. Feel free to streamline the code
generated by removing any unnecessary steps before sending it to the `BiomeAgent__run_code` tool.

You may want to use the consult_api_docs tool to ask questions of the API before running this tool to help refine your goal!

If you use this tool, you MUST indicate so in your thinking. Wrap the tool name in backticks. 

You MUST also be explicit about the goal in your thinking.

Args:
    api (str): The name of the API to use
    goal (str): The task to be performed by the API request. This should be as specific as possible and include any relevant details such as the `ids` or other parameters that should be used to get the desired result.

Returns:
    str: Depending on the user defined configuration will do one of two things.
         Either A) return the raw generated code. Or B) Will attempt to run the code and return the result or
         any errors that occurred (along with the original code). if an error is returned, you may consider
         trying to fix the code yourself rather than reusing the tool.
