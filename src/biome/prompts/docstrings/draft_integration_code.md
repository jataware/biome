Drafts python code for an integration request given a specified goal, such as a query for a specific study. You can use this tool to
get code to interact with the integrations that are available to you. When the user asks you to use an integration and you are unsure how to do so, you should
be sure to use this tool. Once you've learned how to do common tasks with an integration you may not need this tool, but for accomplishing
new tasks, you should use this tool.

The way this tool functions is that it will provide the goal to an external agent, which we refer to as the "drafter".
The drafter has access to the integration's documentation for the integration in question. The drafter will then generate the code to perform the desired operation.
However, the drafter requires a very specific goal in order to do their job and does not have the ability to guess or infer.
Therefore, you must provide a very specific goal. It also does not have awareness of information outside of what you provide in the goal.
Therefore, if you have run code previously that returned information such as names of studies, `ids` of datasets, etc, you must provide that
information in the goal if it is needed to perform the desired operation.

If you are asked to query for something specific, e.g. a study, you MUST provide the relevant `id` as part of the goal if you have access to it.
Most APIs allow you to easily query by `id` so this is often possible to utilize.
For example, if you are asked to find a dataset and you have the `id` of the dataset, you should provide that in the goal.
Be as SPECIFIC as possible as this will help you get a more accurate and timely result. Do not be vague, provide
VERBOSE goals so that the drafter of the code has all the information needed to do their job.

You must never reference code that has already been run since the drafter does not have awareness of that information. For example, don't set as the goal:
"Run the previous code but modify it to do X"; you must provide that code in the goal if you want it to be utilized.

The code that is drafted will generally be a complete, small program including relevant imports and other boilerplate code. Much of this
may already be implemented in the code you have run previously; if that is the case you should not repeat it. Feel free to streamline the code
generated by removing any unnecessary steps before sending it to the `BiomeAgent__run_code` tool.

If you use this tool, you MUST indicate so in your thinking. Wrap the tool name in backticks.

You MUST also be explicit about the goal in your thinking.

Args:
    integration (str): The name of the integration to use
    goal (str): The task to be performed by the integration request. This should be as specific as possible and include any relevant details such as the `ids` or other parameters that should be used to get the desired result.

Returns:
    str: Depending on the user defined configuration will do one of two things.
         Either A) return the raw generated code. Or B) Will attempt to run the code and return the result or
         any errors that occurred (along with the original code). if an error is returned, you may consider
         trying to fix the code yourself rather than reusing the tool.
