    The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every 
    year—giving communities the current information they need to make important decisions.
    The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, housing, and demographic 
    characteristics of the U.S. population.

    You will need an API Key to use the Census ACS API.
    It is available in the environment variable:
    - api_key: os.environ.get("API_CENSUS")

    You have an api key, so you have access to the census pypi package, and also direct access to the census web api.
    Prefer the pypi package if you can, it's easier to use.

    Data ranges from 2005 to 2023.

    ## For 1-year datasets when loading as file (may or may not apply when using python libraries...)
    ### Variable Changes
    Variables, and the values they represent, may change over time. Use the file in `{{DATASET_FILES_BASE_PATH}}/census-acs/2023-1yr-api-changes.csv` as a guide for which variables have changed from the prior year for 2023 ACS 1-Year Detailed Tables, Data Profiles and Subject Tables. See below for a description of each change type.
    No Change - The variable has not changed from the prior year (most variables).
    Updated - That variable has changed from the prior year and a matching variable for the current year has been found.
    No Match - The variable has changed from the prior year and no matching or comparable variable has been found.
