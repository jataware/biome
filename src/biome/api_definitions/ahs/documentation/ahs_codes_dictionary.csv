More information on these codes can be found at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/geographies/reference-files.html. <br/> <br/> Census maintains the Master Address File (MAF), which contains a record for every housing unit in the nation and acts as a frame for many Census administered surveys. From 2015 onwards, the American Housing Survey (AHS) drew its sample from the MAF. While the geographic codes on the MAF are highly accurate, they are imperfect. During sample selection, a small percentage of housing units selected from the MAF have incorrect or missing geography variables. In the case of missing geography data, Census will impute values. This may impact the county values from survey year to survey year.",

Average monthly costs are estimated from regression models developed from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE). The RECS collects data on electricity consumption and costs, as well as some housing and household characteristics similar to those collected in the AHS. Housing and household characteristics and heating and cooling degree days from the AHS are used as inputs to the models. Separate models are applied to units that use electricity alone and those that use both electricity and natural gas. When electricity is billed separately or can be modeled separately, the models estimate electricity consumption, which is converted into costs with price data. When the electric bill is combined with a utility that cannot be modeled separately (i.e., oil, other fuels, trash, water), the models estimate costs with additional information on either the last bill or the respondent's best estimate of average monthly electric costs.
