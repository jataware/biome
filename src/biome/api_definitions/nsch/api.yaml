  You have access to knowledge from the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) data, available every year from 
  2016 to 2023. This dataset API can help answer questions about children's health, healthcare access, family functioning, 
  neighborhood characteristics, and social determinants of health for children aged 0-17 years in the United States.

    You have access to file-based National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) data
    from 2016 to 2023, located under the `/jupyter/data/census-nsch` directory.
    The NSCH files are located and named per year as follows:
    - /jupyter/data/census-nsch/2023e_topical.sas7bdat
    - /jupyter/data/census-nsch/2021e_topical.sas7bdat
    - /jupyter/data/census-nsch/2019e_topical.sas7bdat
    - /jupyter/data/census-nsch/2018e_topical.sas7bdat
    - /jupyter/data/census-nsch/2017e_topical.sas7bdat
    - /jupyter/data/census-nsch/2016e_topical.sas7bdat
    - Codebook: /jupyter/data/census-nsch/nsch_dictionary_codebook.csv

    The NSCH is a national survey that collects information on the health and well-being of children ages 0-17 years 
    in the United States and the factors that may relate to their well-being. The survey includes data on physical and 
    mental health, access to quality health care, and the child's family, neighborhood, school, and social context.

    The NSCH is also designed to assess the prevalence and impact of special health care needs among children in the US and 
    explores the extent to which children with special health care needs (CSHCN) have medical homes,
    adequate health insurance, access to needed services, and adequate care coordination.
    Other topics may include functional difficulties, transition services,
    shared decision-making, and satisfaction with care. 
    Information is collected from parents or caregivers who know about the child's health.
    It also examines the physical and emotional health of children ages 0-17 years of age.
    These factors include access to - and quality of - health care, family interactions, parental health, 
    neighborhood characteristics, as well as school and after-school experiences (example: child screen time).

    To read these SAS7BDAT files with pandas, use:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    filename = "/jupyter/data/census-nsch/2023e_topical.sas7bdat"
    df = pd.read_sas(filename, format="sas7bdat")
    ```
    
    The NSCH datasets include state identifiers (FIPSST) and other geographic information that can be used
    for regional analysis. Check which geographic variables are available in each year's dataset before
    attempting to use them.

    When working with NSCH data, be aware that:
    1. Variable names may change slightly between survey years
    2. Many variables use coded responses (e.g. subset for examples: 1=Yes||2=No, 1 = Never served in the military||2 = Only on active duty for training in the Reserves
      You'll need to use the nsch codebook to decode these variable response codes-
      The codebook is available at /jupyter/data/census-nsch/nsch_dictionary_codebook.csv
      You may open it with pandas and find the "Variable" name, the "Question", "Description", and its "Response Code"s, etc.
      The Response Code options/alternatives per column are separated by a double pipe (||),such as "1=Yes||2=No"
      In the codebook, the Question itself is under the "Question" column

    You'll see mentions of "screener" and "topical" in the code book- some screener properties are present in the topical files,
    which makes it confusing, unfortunately.

    Codebook columns:
    ['Variable',  # => variable code/name
    'Source',     # => source, a question category from "Topical", "Screener", "Operational"
    'Topic',
    'Survey Years',  => available in which file years (eg if 2016, 2017), only check for that variable in the corresponding files, may not be available in files for other years
    'Response Code', => 1=Yes||2=No, etc
    'Description',   => description of the question/variable
    'Question',      => Question text as a human would ask it
    'Type',
    'Universe',
    'Availability',
    'Imputation Strategy',
    'User Notes']

    Instead of assuming a specific column or variable exists, or if you wish to match with a specific column pattern,
    try to compare substrings instead if an exact match is not found. For example, if you need data related to asthma, try
    to check for the 'asth' substring in the column names. Another example: children age may be under SC_AGE_YEARS (not CHILDREN_AGE), as another example.
    Use the codebook, filter out variables or meanings, don't just assume a random color code column of, say, K6Q65A, exists
    since it may have existed in previous or new years- the surveys change and the codes aren't obvious.
