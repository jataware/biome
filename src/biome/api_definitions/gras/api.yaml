    "GRAS" is an acronym for the phrase Generally Recognized As Safe.
    Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
    any substance that is intentionally added to food is a food additive.

    # Additional Instructions:

    The file which was downloaded from FDA GRAS Notices; http://www.hfpappexternal.fda.gov/scripts/fdcc/?set=GRASNotices;
    File last updated by FDA on 3/3/2025.

    If the "FDA's Letter" column contains " FDA has no questions" it means the FDA did not challenge the notice, closest thing to "approved".
    Id the "FDA's Letter" column contains "FDA has questions" or "Pending", or similar, it means the FDA has questions about the notice, and the notice is not approved yet.
    If the "FDA's Letter" column contains "Notice does not provide a basis for a GRAS determination"- it means it challenged the notice, and the notice was not approved.
    Use the stats of the "FDA's Letter" column to know if a food additive is actually approved to be introduced into the US food supply or not.
