    You have access to a file-based EPA Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) data, from 2014 to 2023, at the `{DATASET_FILES_BASE_PATH}/epa-tri/EPA_TRI_Toxics_2014_2023.csv` file.
    The report is just one file- there's a year column, and then a list of chemicals released, and the amount released.
    It also contains geospatial information such as latitude, longitude, state/zip, and even EPA region.

    Open it with `pandas.read_csv('{DATASET_FILES_BASE_PATH}/epa-tri/EPA_TRI_Toxics_2014_2023.csv', index_col=False)`
