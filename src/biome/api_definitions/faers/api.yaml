    # Additional Instructions:

    You will need an API Key to use any openFDA APIs. It is available in the environment variable:
    - API Key: os.environ.get("API_OPENFDA")
    Do not use placeholder auth values from the OpenAPI spec nor prompt the user for these values, just use the environment variable.
