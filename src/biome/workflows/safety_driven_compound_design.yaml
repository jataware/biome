  - name: Pharmacovigilance Signal Detection
    steps:
      - prompt: |
          Query the FDA FAERS database to analyze adverse event patterns for the specified drug class or therapeutic area:
          * Identify the most frequently reported adverse events
          * Analyze event severity and outcomes (hospitalization, death, etc.)
          * Examine time-to-onset patterns for different adverse events
          * Compare AE profiles across different compounds in the class
          
          Focus on identifying 3-5 key safety signals that appear consistently across multiple drugs.
      - prompt: |
          Perform demographic and co-medication analysis of the adverse events:
          * Patient age, gender, and comorbidity patterns
          * Concomitant medications that might contribute to events
          * Dose-response relationships where available
          * Geographic or temporal trends in reporting
          
          Identify patient populations or conditions that appear at higher risk.

  - name: Chemical Structure-Safety Analysis
    steps:
      - prompt: |
          Query the ChEMBL SQLite database at chembl_35/chembl_35_sqlite/chembl_35.db for compounds
          associated with the identified safety signals:
          * Retrieve chemical structures and molecular descriptors
          * Gather target activity profiles and selectivity data
          * Extract pharmacokinetic and ADMET properties
          * Identify common structural scaffolds or functional groups
          > Note: if the ChEMBL database is not available, you can can download it from https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/ChEMBLdb/latest/chembl_35_sqlite.tar.gz
          
          Focus on compounds that show the adverse events identified in the FAERS analysis.
      - prompt: |
          Perform structure-activity relationship analysis:
          * Identify common structural motifs in compounds with safety issues
          * Analyze molecular properties (MW, logP, polar surface area, etc.)
          * Compare target binding profiles of safe vs problematic compounds
          * Look for off-target activities that correlate with adverse events
          
          Generate hypotheses about structural features that contribute to toxicity.

  - name: Safety Liability Assessment
    steps:
      - prompt: |
          Create a comprehensive safety liability profile including:
          * Structural alerts and problematic chemical features
          * Target-based safety concerns (on-target and off-target)
          * Patient population risk factors
          * Dose and exposure considerations
          * Mechanism-based predictions for toxicity
          
          Rank safety concerns by severity, frequency, and predictability.
      - prompt: |
          Cross-reference findings with known safety pharmacology data:
          * hERG, CYP450, and other safety target interactions
          * Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity structure alerts
          * Hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity patterns
          * Central nervous system and cardiovascular risks
          
          Validate the identified safety signals against established safety knowledge.
