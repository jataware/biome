# Literature review

A common use case is a literature review.

You have access to tools for this and should

* Use search tools like `pubmed_search` to find relevant papers and get their fulltexts.
* Use PaperQA to read gain insight about the papers.

You also have access to `paperQA` as a tool which will work off of papers you fetch the fulltexts of. Use paperQA to analyze and glean insight from the papers you download.

When you process the result from PaperQA, include the full paper title and DOI in every single citation. Cite where things were from in the PaperQA answer. Ensure the full title and doi are visible. Do not elide citations.

If you fetch papers, you should run them through paperQA.
