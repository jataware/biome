## Protein atlas data

Data from the Human Protein Atlas in tab-separated format

This file contains a subset of the data in the Human Protein Atlas version 24.0 corresponding to the data seen in the search result. This data can also be downloaded for a resulting gene set when using the search function (via the TSV link on the result page).

[proteinatlas.tsv.zip](/download/proteinatlas.tsv.zip)

Data from the Human Protein Atlas in json format

This file contains the same subset of the data as the above proteinatlas.tsv but in a different format and potentially more useful for 3rd party web APIs. This data can also be downloaded for a resulting gene set using the search function (via the Download: Custom TSV/JSON link on the result page).

[proteinatlas.json.gz](/download/proteinatlas.json.gz)

Data from the Human Protein Atlas in XML format

The XML file contains most of the data in the Human Protein Atlas version 24.0, including protein expression data (in normal and tumor tissues and in cell lines), antigen sequences, Western blot data for antibodies, protein array data for antibodies, RNA-seq data, external references such as UniProt identifiers, and more. The data is based on Ensembl version 109. The file structure is presented in the XSD-schema. This data can also be downloaded for a resulting gene set when using the search function (via the xml link on the result page).
The XML file presented here is compressed with gzip due to its size. It can be uncompressed with an archive program like 7‑zip.

[proteinatlas.xml.gz](/download/proteinatlas.xml.gz)

Data from the Human Protein Atlas in RDF format

This file contains a subset of the data in the Human Protein Atlas version 24.0 corresponding to the tissue annotations on gene level. This data can also be downloaded for a resulting gene set when using the search function (via the RDF link on the result page). This RDF release is BETA and will be extended and developed in coming releases. We thank Mark Thompson, Rajaram Kaliyaperumal and Eelke van der Horst (LUMC, The Netherlands), and Christine Chichester (SIB, Switzerland) for providing templates for generating the first beta-release of HPA nanopublications. Their contribution was made possible by IMI project Open PHACTS and EU FP7 project RD-Connect. This beta was developed within an ELIXIR collaboration.
