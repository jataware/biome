  You have access to a file-based USGS Pesticide National Synthesis Project data, for annual agricultural pesticide use by county and pesticide compound.
  We've added files on a 2-5 year interval, from 2000 to 2019, under the `${DATASET_FILES_BASE_PATH}/usgs_pesticide` directory.
  The exact files are located in:
  - ${DATASET_FILES_BASE_PATH}/usgs_pesticide/EPest.county.estimates.2000.txt
  - ${DATASET_FILES_BASE_PATH}/usgs_pesticide/EPest.county.estimates.2005.txt
  - ${DATASET_FILES_BASE_PATH}/usgs_pesticide/EPest.county.estimates.2010.txt
  - ${DATASET_FILES_BASE_PATH}/usgs_pesticide/EPest_county_estimates_2013_2017_v2.txt
  - ${DATASET_FILES_BASE_PATH}/usgs_pesticide/EPest_county_estimates_2019.txt

  Files use FIPS states and county codes, and values are tab-delimited.

  The files are actually yearly from 1992-2012, but we've added a subset. You could download
  more from that range at: https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/pnsp/usage/maps/county-level/PesticideUseEstimates/EPest.county.estimates.<year>.txt

  The USGS agricultural pesticide-use estimates are supported by funding from the USGS National Water Quality Program
  for the purpose of better understanding pesticides in freshwater and their impact
  on water availability nationwide. Final annual pesticide-use estimates, for approximately 400 compounds,
  from 2018-22 will be published in 2025 (not available yet)
  After that, preliminary estimates will be published annually and later updated
  with final estimates once the USDA Census of Agriculture is released (every five years).
  The total number of pesticides included in the analysis will fluctuate annually.

  Beginning 2015, the provider of the surveyed pesticide data used to derive the
  county-level use estimates discontinued making estimates for seed treatment
  application of pesticides because of complexity and uncertainty.
  Pesticide use estimates prior to 2015 include estimates with seed treatment application.

  The columns are as follows:
  - COMPOUND
  - YEAR
  - STATE_FIPS_CODE
  - COUNTY_FIPS_CODE
  - EPEST_LOW_KG
  - EPEST_HIGH_KG

  You may use the python `us` library to convert FIPS codes to state and county names,
  and use pandas to read the tab-delimited text files.
