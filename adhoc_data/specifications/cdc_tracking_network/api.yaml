  The Tracking Program collects, integrates, analyzes, and disseminates non-infectious disease,
  environmental, and socio-economic data from various sources.
  These include a collective of national, state, and local partners.

  This is an HTTP API, where the usage is free but rate-limiting is applied heavily when not using an API KEY.
  You will need an API Key. It is available in the environment variable:
  - apiToken: os.environ.get("API_CDC_TRACKING_NETWORK")

  To fully understand specifics about what data is or is not available,
  you must run code against the API to see what features are available at
  what level of geography.

  ${user_guide}

  Never simulate this API- if it is not available ask the user how to proceed.
