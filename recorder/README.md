## Requirements

- nodejs / npm

## Initial setup

```
npm install
```

# Running

Web View:
```
npm run dev
```

Electron App:
```
npm start
```

## TODOs

- Setup to use dev url (localhost React app) on dev, else use built js assets for viewer on prod.
There are some guide on this around, it's a matter of addressing it.
- Check if webview needs to get moved outside of react app. If so, move it outside and then navigate to the react app for the rest of the steps after recording.
- Prettify app.
