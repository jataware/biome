Thesesamples can be a \nsubset of the data available in an existing study, or result from the combination of \nmultiple existing studies. This cohort of samples can then be queried or explored \njust like a traditional study, and can be returned to at a later date or shared with a \ncollaborator. In this tutorial, we will create a virtual study \ncomprised of a subset of samples from two existing \nTCGA glioma studies. \nWe begin by selecting the studies of interest and \nviewing them in the Study Summary page. Creating a virtual study: Selecting studies \n1. Use the search \nbox to find the \nstudies of interest \n2. Select the studies \nof interest \n3. Click \u201cExplore \nSelected Studies\u201d \nLink to this page Creating a virtual study: Study summary page \nClick on the       to see \nthe list of studies \nThis is the same Study Summary page that you see for a single study, but now \nwith data from 2 studies. \nLink to this page Creating a virtual study: Study summary page \nUse this table to \nselect samples with \nIDH1 mutations \n(Click the check box in the \u201c#\u201d \ncolumn,then \u201cSelect Samples\u201d at \nthe bottom of the table) In this example, we will additionally filter to samples with mutations in IDH1. \nLink to this page We are now ready to create our virtual study. \nWhat you see will differ slightly depending on if you \nare logged in or not. The next two slides show what \nthe virtual study button looks like in each scenario. \nVirtual study button (not logged in) \nEnter a name for your \nvirtual study (optional) \nClick on the link to open \nyour virtual study, or \nclick \u201cCopy\u201d to copy the \nURL to your clipboard.

Virtual study: Study summary page \nWe can now see the study summary page for our newly created virtual study. You \ncan now explore these samples or run a query, just like with a traditional study. \nRemember that while making this study we filtered down to IDH1 mutant samples, but the non-mutant \nsamples were still present. Now, those samples without mutations are completely gone. \nClick on the       to see the \ndescription of this virtual study \nLink to this page Logging in to cBioPortal: \nIf you use a private instance of cBioPortal, you might \nalready go through an authentication process \n(through your university, for example). If so, there is \nnothing else you need to do. \nBut if you don\u2019t normally log in, then let\u2019s go through \nhow this works.

On the next slide is a query for IDH1, IDH2, EGFR and \nTP53 in the TCGA LGG PanCan Atlas Dataset. What happens in a regular query? \nWhat happens in a regular query? \nThis query looks for samples with alterations in IDH1, IDH2, EGFR and TP53. We \ncan see that the presence of any of four different alterations (Amplification, Deep \nDeletion, Mutation or Structural Variant) define a sample as having an alteration in \na query gene. \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nBut how were those four types of alterations selected? How do we know if an \nalteration isn\u2019t present in the data or just isn\u2019t being examined in this query? \nFor example, are there samples with shallow deletions in any of the query genes? \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nIf you hover over a gene name, you can see the specific alterations which were \nincluded in the query: \u201cMUT\u201d, \u201cFUSION\u201d, \u201cAMP\u201d, \u201cHOMDEL\u201d. These are the default \nOQL options and will highlight any mutation, fusion/structural variant, amplification \nor homozygous/deep deletion in the query gene. \nNote: Not all studies have all datatypes, for example many studies do not have fusion/structural variant calls. \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nSo let\u2019s come back to this question: are there samples with shallow deletions in \nany of the query genes? \nShallow deletions were not included in the OQL forthis query, so there may be \nshallow deletions affecting these genes, but we won\u2019t see them because the query \ndidn\u2019t look for them. \nWhat if we want to include shallow deletions? How do we do that? Let\u2019s learn how \nto use OQL! The Rules of OQL \nOQL useskeywords to define the \nalterations to include in a query. \nTo the right is a table defining the \ngeneral keywords (top) and the \nmodifiers which can be applied to \ncertain keywords (bottom). The \ncomplete specifications can be \nfound here. \nLink to this page Using OQL \nLet\u2019s re-create our initial query. On the left is the query as we ran it before. On the \nright are two different ways to write the exact same query using OQL. Using OQL \nThe general format for OQL is \u201cGENE: ALTERATION1 ALTERATION2 ...\u201d. But as \nshown inthe bottom example, the \u201cDATATYPES\u201d command allows a user to select \nthe same set of alterations for multiple genes all at once. \nHere each gene is listed on its \nown line, followed by a colon \nand then the list of alterations. \nRather than writing the same alterations \nafter each gene, the \u201cDATATYPES\u201d \ncommand can be used to set the \nalterations for multiple genes at once. Using OQL \nNow let\u2019s adjust the default query. Let\u2019s look for gains in EGFR and shallow \ndeletions in TP53. Add \u201cGAIN\u201d \nand\u201cHETLOSS\u201d to the query: \nOncoPrint now includes gains in EGFR and shallow deletions in TP53: \nLink to this page Using OQL \nWhat if we want to look at IDH1 R132C mutations, but no other IDH1 alteration? \nWe can specify a specific \nmutation in OQL: \nWe then seethat there are many fewer samples with mutations in IDH1 since we \nhave limited the query to the relatively rare R132C. \nLink to this page Using OQL \nWe can further refine the query by removing alteration types that are not \nbiologically relevant, like deep \ndeletions in IDH2 & EGFR: \nLink to this page \nOQL Example: \nBRCA1/2 inactivation in ovarian cancer OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLoss of BRCA1 is a common event in ovarian cancer. What percentage of \nsamples lose BRCA1? Let\u2019s run a query to find out: OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Looking at OncoPrint, we can see that 12% of cases have an alteration in each of \nBRCA1 and BRCA2. However, this includes amplifications, which will not result in \na loss of function. We can use OQL to make the query more specific. \nOQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nModify the query to include only \nmutations and deep deletions: \nOncoPrint now shows a more accurate estimate of the frequency of BRCA1/2 loss: \nLink to this page OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page However, mutations and deletions are not the only way to decrease the levels of \nfunctional protein in a cell. DNA methylation can lead to decreased mRNA \nexpression. We can use the \n\u201cPlots\u201d tab to examine the \nrelationship between DNA \nmethylation and gene \nexpression. Note that the \nlower right quadrant \ncontains samples with low \nexpression and high DNA \nmethylation. We can also \nuse OQL to identify these \nsamples. OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nModify the query to also include samples with decreased expression (don\u2019t forget to \nselect \u201cmRNA Expression\u201d in \nthe \u201cGenomics Profiles\u201d section): \nOncoPrint now shows a more accurate estimate of the frequency of BRCA1 loss: \nLink to this page OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Some mutations in the OncoPrint are variants ofunknown significance. Recall from \nthe Single Study Query Tutorial  that mutations are annotated as \u201cputative drivers\u201d \nor \u201cunknown significance\u201d based on this settings menu in the header: OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nWe can further refine the query by only including those mutations which are \nputative drivers, as defined by the settings menu. We can do this by: \n-Adding _DRIVER to the MUT term in OQL. This will include only mutations that \nare putative drivers (see BRCA1 below) \n-Or, replace the entire OQL string with DRIVER. This will include mutations, \nfusions/structural variant and copy number changes that are putative drivers \n(see BRCA2 below) OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Compare the result of this latest query (top) with the previous query (bottom) and \nsee that the mutations of unknown significance are no longer present. OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page This study is one of the few in cBioPortal that includes germline mutations. We can \nmake one final adjustment to our query to ask a slightly different question: what \npercentage of samples have putative driver germline mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2? \nNote that the OQL for BRCA1 and BRCA2 are equivalent as the GERMLINE term \nonly applies to mutations. OQL Example: \nRTK pathway alterations OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nAlterations in RTK signaling pathway members are common in colorectal \nadenocarcinoma. What is the pattern of alterations across the different levels of the \nsignaling pathway? \nRecall that RTKs (e.g. EGFR, \nERBB2) activate RAS (KRAS, \nNRAS, HRAS) which in turn \nactivate RAF (BRAF, ARAF, \nRAF1) which in turn activate \nMEK (MAP2K1, MAP2K2). \nLet\u2019s query all of these genes: OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page We see here an overview of each individual gene in the pathway. However, it can \nbe informative to instead see each level of the pathway grouped together. OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page We can use gene tracks to group genes together in the OncoPrint. The format is \n[\u201coptional track name\u201d GENE1 GENE2 \u2026 ]: \nOQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page Gene tracks can be combined with other OQL \nterms, either using the DATATYPES command \nas shown here, or attaching OQL to genes \nwithin the square brackets. \nNow we can clearly visualize the pattern of mutual exclusivity of driver alterations at \neach level of the pathway. OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nGene tracks can also be expanded to see tracks for individual genes. To expand, \nclick the    symbol next to the track. \nNote that OncoPrint, Mutual Exclusivity and Group Comparison are the only tabs that currently \nsupport gene tracks.

Q: Is there an association between alterations \nin a particular query gene and age? \nA: We can see that patients with mutations or \namplifications in EGFR tend to be older than \nthose with mutations in IDH1/IDH2 \nLink to this page Now we\u2019re going to go through all the other tabs and \nask some questions about alterations in IDH1 , IDH2  \nand EGFR  in the TCGA Lower-Grade Glioma study. \nNote: Depending on the data available for a \nparticular study, not all of the following tabs will be \npresent (e.g. a study without expression data will not \nhave a Co-expression tab) Cancer Types Summary \nHover over a bar to see \nadditional details. Histogram of the frequency of alterations in \neach gene for each detailed cancer type. \nQ: Are alterations in EGFR more frequent in a \nparticular subtype of glioma? \nA: Yes, astrocytoma appears to have a much \nhigher frequency of EGFR alteration than \noligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma. \nLink to this page Options to \ncustomize \nvisualization Plots for all \nqueried genes \ntogether and \neach individual \ngene are \navailable as \nseparate tabs. \nMutual Exclusivity \nAll pairwise \ncombinations of query \ngenes analyzed for \nmutual exclusivity or \nco-occurrence in the \nqueried samples. On the OncoPrint tab we could \nsee visually that alterations in \nthese three query genes tended to \nbe mutually exclusive. Here we \ncan address that same question \nwith a statistical analysis. \nA positive value here suggests that alterations \nin these genes co-occur in the same samples, \nwhile a negative value suggests that \nalterations in these genes are mutually \nexclusive and occur in different samples. \nlog2(                                               ) odds of alteration in B given alteration in A \nodds of alteration in B given lack of alteration in A \nLink to this page Click on any \ncolumn header to \nsort.

Co-Expression \nQ: Several genes on chr7 show high expression correlation with \nEGFR within this cohort (see table on the left). Why might that be? \nA: EGFR is also located on chr7 and is frequently gained in some \nsubtypes of glioma which could explain these correlated increases in \nexpression. This can be further explored in the \u201cCN Segments\u201d tab. \nLink to this page Comparison \nThis tab enables the comparison of all available data types between \nsamples with or without alterations in the query genes. This tab replaces \nand enhances the old \u201cEnrichments\u201d tab. \nThe Comparison tab is the same as the Group Comparison functionality \nthat is accessible from Study View. See the Group Comparison Tutorial  \nfor more details about the functionality of this tab. \nBy default, the \u201cAltered\u201d (one or more \nalterations in one or more query genes) \nand \u201cUnaltered\u201d (no alterations in any \nquery gene) groups are selected. Groups can be toggled on or off by \nclicking on them them.

This subtab will only be visible if outcome data \nis available for the selected study. \nNote: These plots reflect \ndata as provided by the \nstudy. We do not perform \nany additional processing. \nQ: Do patients with alterations in \nIDH1 have different outcomes \ncompared to patients with \nalterations EGFR? \nA: Patients with alterations in IDH1 \nhave significantly better OS than \npatients with alterations in EGFR. Comparison: Clinical \nLink to this page Click on a clinical \nattribute to visualize \nthe data in the plot \non the right. The Clinical subtab compares all available clinical \ndata among the selected groups. Comparison: Molecular Profiles \nLink to this page The molecular profiles \nsubtabs replace the old \n\u201cEnrichments\u201d tab. \nThese analyses ask whether \nGenomic Alterations \n(mutations/copy-number \nalterations) or mRNA \nexpression or protein \nexpression in a particular \ngene is enriched in one of the \nselected groups.

Patient View, Example 2: Sample Summary \nClicking on a sample ID on one \nof the previous pages brings up \nthis sample-specific page. \nLink to this page \nOk, now that we\u2019ve seen what data is present in \nPatient View, we can start asking some fun question! \nLet\u2019s look at RAS mutations in Uterine Corpus \nEndometrial Carcinoma (TCGA, Nature 2013). Link to this page Example 3: Run the query \nExample 3: OncoPrint \nLink to this page In general, mutations in these genes are \nmutually exclusive. However, there\u2019s one case \nwith driver mutations in both KRAS and NRAS. \nLet\u2019s look at that patient in greater detail by \nclicking on the patient ID (\u201cTCGA-B5-A0JV\u201d). \nExample 3: Patient View \n3. Could this be related to \ndifferences in clonality? Perhaps the \nPIK3CA mutation is clonal while the \nNRAS & KRAS mutations are in two \ndistinct subclones. If that theory is \ncorrect, we would expect to see \nothermutations with similar variant \nallele frequencies. Indeed,we can \nsee that is true by looking at the \nhistogram of variant allele frequency. 2. Note that all three genes are \ndiploid, so the differences are unlikely \nto arise from copy number alteration. \nLink to thispage 1. Look at the Allele Freq column for each mutation. NRAS \nQ61K (19%) and KRAS G12D (21%) have similar variant \nallele frequencies, but PIK3CA E542K is twice as high (38%). Summary of Example 3 : Using Patient View, we \ncan infer the clonality of mutations and understand \nhow two mutations, which are usually mutually \nexclusive, can be present in the same tumor sample. \nIn this case, the KRAS and NRAS mutations appear \nto be present in two distinct subclones of a single \ntumor.

CDS \ncurrently hosts a variety of data types from NCI projects and programs such as the \nHuman Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), Division of Cancer Control and Population \nSciences (D CCPS), and Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI), as well as data from \nindependent research projects.  \nCDS provides data -sharing capabilities for additional studies that fall under the following \ncategories:  \n\u2022 Studies with data that do not match any existing CRDC data commons  \n\u2022 Studies with data that do not fit current data type criteria for any CRDC data \ncommons  \nStudies with data that are on a waiting list to become part of  a CRDC Submission  must \nfollow  the steps  described  in \u201cHow to Submit Data \u201d on page 2.  \nSearching the data housed in CDS is easy to do through the Data page, which has a filter \nfunction to find data by categories.  \nAccess to c ontrolled data requires approval from the NIH Data Access Committee  \nthrough the dbGaP  process . 2 Open -access data is publicly accessible  and does not require any approvals. Being a \ncloud repository, CDS does not facilitate direct downloads of data, owing to high data \ndownload charges. However, programs/initiatives can reach out to the CDS Help Desk  to \nrequest downloads if they are willing to fund download s by users approved to access \ntheir data. Please contact the CDS helpdesk for more  information.  \nAccess to data in CDS for review and/or analysis is through the NCI\u2019s Cloud Resource, \nVelsera Cancer Genomics Cloud  (Velsera /CGC)  (formerly Seven Bridges). See below for a \ndescription of how to select data and import to Velsera /CGC . \nHow to Submit Data  \nThe CDS data s ubmission process ensure s that CDS is the correct  repository to use to  \nshare the data  and metadata collected  and allow basic searches across the data.  The \nprocess enables data release according to open or controlled access requirements.  \n1. Pre-requisites  for data submission:  \na. In the dbGaP registration system , provide the CDS Federal Lead with \ndbGaP Streamlined access to the study . \nb. Select DCF (Data Commons Framework) as the External Database . \nc. Provide dbGaP with the standardized CDS statement for dbGaP release \nnotes .  \nSample statement:  \u201cNote for data in CDS : The data for this study are \navailable via the NCI Cancer Data Service. More information about the NCI \nCDS is available here:  https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/cancer -\ndata -service . The data can be accessed via the Cancer Genomics Cloud \n(https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/datasets/file -repository ).\u201d \nd. Complete the metadata manifest . \ni. Refer  to the CDE Browser  and caDSR  to search for permissible \nvalues (PV)  of metadata elements . \n2. Get started : \na. Complete the CDS New Request Questionnaire . \nb. Contact the CDS Helpdesk email  with questions or comments . \nc. When CDS receives  the completed New Request Questionnaire , they \nschedule  a data intake interview . It takes one week from the time the \nquestionnaire is received to the time the CDS team schedules an hour -long \ninterview . \n3. Discuss the following at the i nitial interview : \na. Questionnaire responses   \nb. Steps taken to de -identify the data  for PHI/PII  \nc. Requirements for d ata storage  and sharing  \nd. CDS Metadata Template  3 e. Review pre -requisites , including  the dbGaP process , if appropriate . \n4. Approval  \na. CDS notif ies the submitter about approval to submit data . This might take \na week if new data types or new requirements are included.  \n5. Submi tter submits  the following : \na. Complete  and Final metadata manifest  \nb. List of Authorized Data Uploaders  (this includes data uploader name/s, \nemail/s ) \n6. Once CDS receives  the Complete and Final metadata manifest, CDS creates Cloud \nBuckets . \na. CDS sends credentials (for uploader , submission POC, PI). This can take up \nto one week . \n7. The s ubmitter upload s data into the CDS  bucket using the provided credentials . \n8. The s ubmitter notifies CDS when submission is complete . \na. CDS locks the bucket , making it read -only . \n9. CDS begins indexing  studies . \n\u2022 This process takes 6 to 8 weeks . \n\u2022 The process includes indexing and authentication and authorization (the \nprocess of data ingestion for release) . \n\u2022 CDS releases the study  data  for secondary sharing on  the CDS page on \nVelsera /CGC (provide link).  \n\u2022 CDS will try to align the release dates with the dbGaP release schedule as \nmuch as possible . \n\u2022 The dbGaP study page provides a link to CDS . Data can be explored on the \nCDS portal and the CDS page on Velsera /CGC . \n10. Access  the controlled access data on Velsera /CGC, from dbGaP . \na. Go to d bGaP and search for the study of interest . \n\u2022 On the dbGaP study page you are redirected to the CDS Data \nCommons page. \n\u2022 Note that t he data is s earchable via  Velsera/CGC  (formerly known \nas SBG-CGC ). \nb. Create an account on Velsera /CGC . \nc. Get approval from dbGaP to access the controlled study . \nd. Access Cancer Data Service (CDS) File Explore . \ne. Copy data into your own space within Velsera and start analysis and \nexploration . \nf.
