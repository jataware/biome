Based on the outcomes from the initial five years of \nresearch funding , an additional  program was launched in August of 2011 entitled  \u201cThe Clinical \nProteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium \u201d, or CPTAC .  CPTAC is a comprehensive and \ncoordinated effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the \napplication of robust,  quantitative, proteomic technologies and workflows.  \nThe participating proteome research groups  in CPTAC  recognized the need for a Common \nData Analysis Pipeline  (CDAP)  in order to remove the multiple sources of variability that would \nresult when trying to compare peptides and proteins inferred by each group  using different \nsoftware .  This overview , for non -proteomic researchers,  explains why and how processing \nchoices produce results that appear to differ both qualitatively and quantitatively.   If you alrea dy \nunderstand the elements of peptide and proteomic analyses using mass spectrometry, you might \nskip this document and proceed to use \u201cA Description of the CPTAC Comm on Data Analysis \nPipeline (CDAP) .\u201d  That document details  stepwise the software programs and output files of the  \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline run at NIST . \nProteomics in a Nutshell  \n{ Note to the reader: If you are completely unfamiliar with proteomics, we suggest reading \n\u201cWhat Is Proteomics \u201d.  There are also numerous reviews which are indexed at PubMed.  \n \nIf you are somewhat familiar with proteomics or are coming at this document from a related \nbackground (e.g., genomics), the following is a brief description and analogy as a refresher. } \n \nTissue samples are digested enzymatically to break large proteins into small segments \n(peptides containing 7 -30 am ino acids) that are amenable to automated analysis and assignment Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n4 \n of their amino acid sequences. The digests contain tens of thousands of peptides .  Each \ntryptically digested tumor sample  mixture is separated  using multiple stages of chromatography \nto allo w more effective mass spectrometric analyses of less complex mixtures.  Typically, a \npatient tumor  sample  digest  was chromatographically separated  into 24 fractions, each of which \nwas analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography  (LC)  coupled to a high -resolution \ntandem mass spectrometer  (MS/MS) .  Once introduced into the mass spectrometer, a small mass \nregion ( containing  1 or a few peptides) is fragmented to produce a sequencing mass ladder where \neach peak in the spectrum ( graph displ aying m/z vs. relative intensity data ) corresponds to a sub -\npeptide, fragmented with missing residues from one end or the other.  It is these mass ladders \nthat are analyzed by comparison to theoretical mass ladders produced by in silico  digestion of a \nFAST A database by a search engine.  \nAn analogy to  the chromatographic separation  and mass spectrometric  characterization  \nprocess is offered  to convey the power of the analytical method  and the complexities associated \nwith reporting the results .   \nSuppose you anticipate  a crowd of more than  100,000 people  at a sporting event , \nand want to characterize that group to profile it relative to other crowds .  To learn how \nmany families are present, which children belong to which parents, how many attendees \nare male or female, how many have red/brown/black/grey/no/other color hair, which \nones are related by marriage, which ones share religious beliefs, as well as  other details \nof their personal lives, it would be helpful to pass them through a turnstile and profile \neach of them individually as they enter the stadium.   \nFor protein digests, t he chromatographic step acts like an imperfect turnstile, \noccasionally  separating peptides as individual s, but more frequently allowing small groups Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n5 \n of 5-50 peptides to enter together.  The tandem mass spectrometer analyzer acts like a \nticket taker and  a discriminating usher, dividing peptides first by size (actually, mass -to-\ncharge or \u2018m/z\u2019 ratio) and then by a host of their secondary characteristics (actually, \u2018MS2 \nspectrum\u2019).  The details that emerge from the MS2 spectrum allow each individual peptide \nto be distinguished and characterized as being related or unrelated to others in the \nmixture.    \nWhy a Common Data Analysis Pipeline?    \nA continuation of this analogy is given in support of a common data analysis pipeline.  \n \nSo how can there be different lists summarizing the characteristics of all of the \nindividuals present in the stadium or proteins in a mixture?  Well, suppose  that the stadium \ndata was  analyzed by crackerjack  polling teams and statisticians  from both The Wall Street \nJournal  and The Washington Post .  The same raw data would be coded and entered  for \nidentical individuals , but two very different profiles of the stadium crowd could  emerge .  \nBoth summaries c ould be valid, and not easily reconciled  by reading  the resulting reports .  \nOne statistical  team  might use home address plus cell phone telephone numbers  plus 2012 \nvoter registration lists to designate  their familial groupings ; the other might use zip code \nplus landline  telephone numbers plus 2010 motor vehicle registration  lists from several \nstates for the same purpose.  The analogous software tools that proteomics specialists \nchoose  have many of the same characteristics that make reconcil iation of a stadium \ncrowd\u2019s characteristics difficult when  different  dated, time -dependent, and incomplete \nreference databases  are used.  Why is this true? Some stadium attendees (babies -toddlers) \nwere born after the databases  were compiled ; some people moved  or married after  the lists Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n6 \n were finalized ; some have changed their phone numbers ; some are visiting from Europe to \nattend a family reunion; others are visiting from Australia  and are unrelated to anyone else \nin the stadium.   Analogous problems arise in every proteomics investigation.  It is \nimpossible  for statistical professional polling teams to accurately align individuals and \nfamily relationships  after the fact, whereas it might  have been obvious to a n attentive  and \nvery inquisitive  usher at the ti me of seating.  Correct assignment of peptides to their parent \nproteins is fraught with all of the problems associated with placement of individuals into \ncorrect family relationships.  While some are unambiguous (distinct peptides that can only \nbelong to a  single protein record , coded by a single gene ), others are shared, common to \nmultiple related proteins  coded by several genes .  The resulting quantitative assessment of \na stadium crowd or a protein list becomes dependent upon the evaluator and the \nevaluat or\u2019s measurement tools.  This becomes even more apparent when time has passed \nand the same evaluators profile another stadium crowd or peptide list , but the databases \nfor their analyses have changed , so that the resulting lists have many non -comparable \nentries.  In contrast, it is certainly possible to c ompar e a stadium crowd at a football \nstadium with an equivalent sized crowd at a baseball stadium many months later if the \nsame evaluators apply the same sets of tools to the crowd characterization .  For this \nreason, the NCI determined that a common data analysis pipeline would be beneficial  for \nreporting  results from multi -institutional cancer tumor proteome studies . \n  Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n7 \n  \nIs Original  Instrument Data Retrievable from the Data Coordinating Center ?   \nData resulting from tandem mass spectrometry analyses is recorded in electronic digital \nfiles and stored in formats that are instrument -specific , unaltered over time, and easily  and \naccurately  replicated .  The  Proteome Characterization Centers (PCCs)  at Vanderbilt University, \nBroad Institute, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  (PNNL) , and Johns Hopkins \nUniversity (JHU)  used Thermo  Fisher mass spectrometers , albeit of  several different models, but \nproducing similarly formatted primary data, denoted as \u2018 Filename.raw\u2019  files.  These \nFilename.raw files were transferred from each participating lab to a central Data Coordinating \nCenter  (see Figure 1).  \nAll Filenames were chosen to follow  a standardized 7 -part naming convention, described in a \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n8 \n document entitled  \u201cCPTAC, TCGA Cancer Proteome Study of Breast Tissue Naming \nConventions \u201d available on the Data Coordinating Center website .  Primary Fi lename .raw files \nare available for public download that preserve the original quality of all the recorded \nexperimental data.   However, to facilitate review of this data for those without access to Thermo  \nFisher proprietary software, the Filename.raw files were converte d to \u2018Filename.mzML\u2019 files.  \nThe Filename.mzML formatted files can be viewed with open source ProteoWizard  software \ntools . Alternatively , the original instrument Filename.raw files can be converted to mz ML or \nother ASCII formats using those same tools, following the installation of MSFileReader  from \nThermo Fisher.  \n  Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n9 \n  \nHow Are Lists of Peptides and Their Intensities Generated at NIST?   \n \nThe processing of  the original  Filename.raw instrument files begins with conversion of the \ndata from  \u2018profile mode\u2019 (point -by-point detail that includes m/z peak shapes, resolution, and \nnoise) to \u2018centroid mode\u2019, simple  peak lists of m/z vs. intensities  (Filename.mgf) . \n  \nThe raw data is preserved in text format profile mode  for isotope analysis and \nquantification software  (Filename.mzXML) .  The file conversion process es use  a NIST \nexpan ded version of the ReAdW   converter software from ISB ReAdw4Mascot2 .  The peak list  \nfile (Filename.mgf)  is annotated to include parameters important to peak area quantificat ion in \niTRAQ experiments  used by Broad, PNNL, and JHU .  The iTRAQ experiment requires each \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n10 \n sample to be reacted with a  chemical label, and as a result, allows 3 patient samples to be  mixed \nand analyzed together with a pooled reference standard  employed for all samples .  The iTRAQ \nexperimental results contain sets of quantitative ratios for each set of 3 patients with respect to \nthe common pooled standard.  The iTRAQ process introduces multiple subtle facto rs into data \nanalysis, and consequently , the Filename.mgf record includes notations for peak purity and \nmissing peaks .  [For a concise description of the iTRAQ quantification method used in these \nanalyses, view this  link.] \nThe next steps are to assign peptide sequences to each MS2 spectrum and perform \nquantitative analyses  (Figure 2) .  There are many software tools for peptide sequence \nassignment, but NCI and NIST  selected MS -GF+ after testing several  alternatives.  MS -GF+ \nrequires a database of protein sequences in a standardized text format (FASTA) in which  each \namino acid  is represented by a single letter code.  The database used  in processing the TCGA \nsamples is the National Center for Biote chnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence \n(RefSeq )  for Homo sapiens (build 37) including  the sequence for  S. scrofa (porcine) trypsin \nadded to each sample .  The RefSeq database is a non -redundant collection of protein sequences  \nfrom archival databases.   A second database compiled from TCGA data for individual patient \ngenes is being evaluated for possible re -analysis with MS -GF+.  NIST developed software for \npeak  profile isotope ana lysis and quantification (ProMS) that uses both the Filename.mzXML \nand Filename.mzid input to produce intermediary  and non -public  working files (Filename. txt). \n  Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n11 \n  \nWhat Types of Analyses Were Performed  on Each Tumor  Type ?  Are They \nDirectly Comparable?  \nTryptically -digested sample s can be divided for the purpose of two different types of \nanalysis \u2013 as peptides, and/or as post -translationally modified peptides.  The PNNL and Broad \ngroups chose to separate and characterize both peptides and post-translationally  phosphorylated \n(addition of a phosphate on serine, threonine or tyrosine hydroxyl groups) peptides as potentially \ncharacteristic of ovarian and breast  tumor biology.  JHU chose to  analyze peptides and  separate \nglycosylated  peptides for ovarian cancer samp les; Vanderbilt did not split the colon cancer \nsamples for post -translational peptide analysis , but added a large sample set of normal colon \ntissues .   \nThe interpretation of mass spectra of phosphorylated peptides requires analysis in addition \nto MS -GF+ in order to assign the likely position(s) of phosphate group attachment, and an \nassessment of the probability of that assignment. The software program PhosphoRS [Taus et al., \nJ Pro teome Res.  2011;10(12):5354 -62] provides that information, and was incorporated into the \npipeline (Figure 2).   \nIn contrast, JHU trapped N-glycosylated peptides onto an ion exchange column, and \nenzymatically cleaved the asparagine -linked peptides prior to elution.  Consequently, the \nresulting de -glycosylated peptides can be sequenced using MS -GF+, with the expectation that \nthe former glycosylated asparagine residues will be identified  as aspartic acid.    \nAlthough the same general technology (liquid chromat ography -tandem mass spectrometry) \nwas used by all of the labs, the results should be expected to differ  because of the above \ndifferences in sample processing .   The iTRAQ -labeled peptides will differ  from  those analyzed Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n12 \n by label -free global analysis . The  iTRAQ/phosphoproteomics will differ from those after  de-\nglycosylation /iTRAQ  analysis.  Each specific analytical method would be expected to reveal \nslightly different characteristics of the tumor samples,  with each one having merit, and all likely \nto yield greater information than any one.  One set of samples was analyzed in part by two \nlaboratories using different techniques.  Both PNNL and JHU analyzed 32 ovarian cancer tumors  \nin common using an iTRAQ/gl obal +phospho method (PNNL) and an iTRAQ global + \ndeglycosylation method (JHU).  \n \nHow Was Quality Control Measured?  Were Standard Reference Materials \nUsed?  \nNIST  perform s quality assessment using parameters derived from each of the output files \nfrom quantitation and isotope analysis [Rudnick  et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 2010;  9(2):225 -41].  \nThe files are reviewed  as complete sets  of runs  so that changes in sample handling, i nstrument \nperformance, chromatography, or computer data handling will be detectable .  Examples of \nmeasured metrics  parameters are shown in Figure s 3 and 4 .   NIST quality control programs \ncalculate and track  more than 40 system characteristics , and four of  those that reflect \nchromatography and mass spectrometry instrument performance are  shown  in Figure 3.  The \nnumber of identified tryptic peptide sequence matches (Figure 4) captures and reflects the \nbottom -line performance consistency for any given laborat ory.   Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n13 \n Figure 3. illustrates the consistency of several different performance metrics for 28 separate \nanalyses collected at one of the Proteome Characterization Centers.  MS1  S/N is the signal -to-\nnoise ratio measured for m/z data after the first stage of orbitrap high -resolution mass analysis; \nMS2 S/N is the same metric after the second stage tandem analysis.  Half -period refers to the \ntime over which the middle 50% of the identified peptides elute, and peak width (fwhm) is a \nmeasure of whether the chromat ographic peaks are changing over time.  Both metrics describe \nchromatographic separation quality and consistency.  \nThe result of NIST QC metric monitoring was an observed consistency within each \nlaboratory  for analyses performed of the TCGA samples .  Becaus e each laboratory conducted \ninternal performance checks, and re-ran samples when  necessary, there were no  failed  patient \nsample runs  found in the data pipeline .  This consistent performance level  was possible because \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n14 \n each participating laboratory  pre-tested their experimental protocol  with system suitability \nstudies  using human -in-mouse xenograft breast cancer tumor reference material (CompRef) \ndistributed to all groups for lab-to-lab and within -laboratory performance check s. The same \nCompRef materials were  run between TCGA samples  for quality control , and the resulting \n\u2018interstitial\u2019 CompRef analyses are available for download on the DCC site .    \n \n \nFigure 4 tracks the number of identified peptides across different experiments from one \nPCC.  Each point is a  mean of the number of peptides ( \u00b1SD)  identified from 24 fractions, as \nillustrated  in the inset graph  for Experiment 5 .  Typically, a lower number of peptides elute in \nthe early and late fractions, and a spread of values is expected  due to biological var iations .  \nMonitoring numbers of peptide sequence matches is a measure of overall PCC  performance .  \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n15 \n How Were Proteins and Genes Assigned?  \nEach peptide sequence in the Filename.psm text report is linked to the list of prot eins that \ncontain that sequence  in the reference database , and as a consequence, an all -inclusive list of all \npossible proteins can be derived from those reports.   However, compiling a n all-inclusive list of \nall possible proteins is not very useful to biologists because it violates the princ iple of parsimony  \n(Occam\u2019s razor) .  Applying this principle, the shortest list of candidate  protein s or genes  that can \nexplain all of the data is more likely to be correct.  Software for performing  parsimonious  protein \nassignments  requires that peptide sequences an d candidate proteins be considered and sorted \ntogether  in order to solve for  the smallest set solution  (Figure 5) .  \nCompounding this task, there are many shared peptides among protein isoforms .  Consequently, \nit is not possible to determine quantitatively how much of each peptide originated from a specific \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n16 \n protein isoform.  Because biologists view proteins as gene products, we elected to bypass the \nprotein isoform conundrum and assign peptides di rectly to a parsimonious set of genes  (Figure \n5), a task performed  at DCC by Dr. Nathan Edwards  using software designed for this purpose .  \nWhile gene assignment  does not eliminate  quantitative  assignment  ambiguity for all cases, \nthe inferred parsimonious set of genes generates a simpler path to the desired output needed by \nbiologists and medi cal professionals, particularly those assessing biological networks and \nsystems.  For biologists interested in biomarker candidates, the only meaningful experimentally  \nmeasured quantitative data resides in the peptide sequence match (Filename.psm) reports.  Any \ninferred summation of quantitative peptide data necessitates compromises . \nWhat Type of Gene Summary Reports are Available?  \nThe gene summaries are experiment specific, so that there are separate sets for PNNL -\novarian, JHU - ovarian, Broad breast, and Va nderbilt colo -rectal cancers.  Each experiment has \ntext summaries, gene-inference ; peptide -gene relationships; gene -inference based quantification \nbased on iTRAQ ratios using m/z117 as a pool reference value; and for label -free (Vanderbilt)  \ngene -inference based spectral count and precursor area quantitation.  \n \nWhy Are Mass Spectral Library Spectra Produced?  \nHow Can They Be Accessed?  \n Mass spectral files accumulated  by the CPTAC project contain >100 million mass \nspectra.  The mass spectrum of each unique peptide sequence exhibits a characteristic \nreproducible pattern of mass/charge vs. intensity, much like an individual\u2019s fingerprint .  \nConsequently, mass spectral libraries of previously characterized components permit very rapid Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n17 \n identification of the  same peptide s when encountered in future studies , a process not unlike \nfinding facts in a library of bound volumes, as illustrated in Figure 7. \n \n \nThe NIST Mass Spectrometry Data Center established repositories  of compound speci fic mass \nspectral data useful for rapid recognition of simple chemical structures like drugs, pesticides, \nsteroids, amino acids, etc., beginning in the 1970s .  These libraries and associated software \nenabling spectral matching have been widely accepted in analytical laboratories worldwide.  \nMore recently,  libraries of tandem mass spectra of peptides recorded using liquid \nchromatographic separ ation, electrospray ionization  using  ion trap -type  instrumentation have \nbeen distributed to the public by NIST after  several steps of curation .  Composite consensus \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n18 \n spectra are derived from comparing many spectra of the same peptide determined at different \nintensi ties, as illustrated in Figure 7.   \n \nCompilations are assembled from spectra acquired using similar mass spectral instrumentation .  \nFor example, the Vanderbilt data yielded a library of > 98 thousand consensus spectra.  These \nwere merged in the latest public release of the NIST Human tandem peptide library that now \ncontain s >340 thousand  consensus  tandem  spectra  recorded using ion trap instrumentation .  Data \nfrom the Broad, JHU, and PNNL studies was collected using a cycloidal ion trap with image \ncurrent detection  (Orbitrap \u2122),  and resulted in a library of  >1 million  consensus  iTRAQ spectra \ndistilled from   > 56 million total collected spectra .   Similarly, s eparat e libraries were compiled \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n19 \n from global and iTRAQ -Phospho Orbitrap \u2122 data sets.   All of these libraries are being distributed \nthrough the NIST public websites or through links accessible on the CPTAC -DCC w ebsite.  \n \nOverview of  Processed Data  \n \nWhat Makes Files from each Institution U nique?  \n The CPTAC studies  of TCGA samples  were planned to utilize state -of-the-art \ninstrumentation i n each institution with the expectation that results are parallel, but not pre cisely \nmirrored.  \n \nTable 1 summarizes some of the key factors that are similar, but differ not only with respect to \ntumor type, but also the sample workup protocol, analytical instrumentation, and  separation.  \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n20 \n How differences in protocols are likely to affect results can be anticipated from general \nunderstanding of the experimental options .  Most importantly, the protocol differences should \nnot alter the underlying biological conclusions reached .  The iTRAQ prot ocol should produce \ntighter quantitative analytical data for comparisons between samples.  Think of competitive track \nracing for an analogy for 4 -plex iTRAQ experiment.  If 4 runners compete in a track race \ntogether and the winner  of the first race compete s with another set of 3 runners,  the result will \nallow precise comparison  of the entire set of seven in the time required to run two races, similar \nto an iTRAQ experiment where 3 samples are mixed with a 4th as a consistent standard.  In \ncontrast, if seve n athletes compete by running individual heats, the seven events will require \nlonger, in analogy to the non -iTRAQ method used by Vanderbilt.   The trade -off is that observers \nof both events view runners either in a group or as individuals.  The iTRAQ exper iment \nsomewhat dilutes the signal for each component, but the non -iTRAQ alternative increase \ncomparative quantitative variability and requires longer instrument time.  Other differences in \nthe protocols (numbers of fractions, type of columns  or fragmentati on) are technical, like \ndifferences in track surface or weather, and not likely to produce substantive differences in data \nsets. \nWhat Makes All Data Sets C omparable?  \n The use of a Common Data Analysis Pipeline results in files that can be directly queried \nand compared with respect to peptides and genes that may be indicative of activated or \nsuppressed pathways in different cancer tumor types.   The parameters listed in Table 2 define   \nsome of the many options that were applied consistently to the processed data sets.  Within \nproteomics, there are many  data analysis software tools, and, in addition to the CDAP, multiple \nanalyses of CPTAC data appear in the scientific literature .  It is likely that summary  data Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n21 \n published by each institution differ s qualitative ly and quantitatively somewhat from that \nprocessed by CDAP  because each lab reports using specifically dated reference databases and \nsoftware tools . \n \nTable 2   \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n22 \n  \nHow and Why Institute Published Data May Differ from CDAP Results  \n First, the bioinformaticians at each Proteome Characterization Center select the search  \nengines, reference databases, and parameters that they believe will produce the most useful and \ncomprehensive data analysis for their output.  While a committee of Proteome Characterization \nCenter members agreed on the publicly accessible and well documented tools and methods for \nthe common pipeline, the same scientists  were free to select software and modify/ extend \ndatabases where they thought there were significant adv antages for processing their own data.   \nFor example, the team at PNNL first \u2018refined\u2019 their mass spectral data, having recognized that \ncertain  instrumental drift could be eliminated while improving the accuracy of m/z assignments.  \nSubsequent peptide searc hing using the same MS -GF+ software enhanced the numbers of \npeptide sequence matches from data relative to CDAP results.  In contrast, the JHU team \nselected  conservative  parameters for processing that yielded slightly fewer peptide sequence \nmatches using t he same MS -GF+ software.  The Broad team prefers a different search engine \n(SpectrumMill, proprietary software  from Agilent ).  Their results substantially agree with those \nfrom the CDAP, but the CDAP\u2019s allowance of semi -tryptic peptides resulted in some pe ptide \nsequence matches that the Broad team prefer s not to include for iTRAQ quantification.  \nVanderbilt\u2019s bioinformatics team elected to use multiple search tools (library search  with \n\u2018Pepitome \u2019 and a  second search engine \u2018MyriMatch \u2019) to improve their abil ity to assign spectra \nrelative to the single MS -GF+ search  used by CDAP .  The multiple search engine and library \nstrategies are well documented to enhance  peptide sequence matching for the  global label -free \nproteomics using Collisional Induced Dissociation  (CID) fragmentation in the LC/MS/MS \nexperiment performed at  Vanderbilt.  Library search strategies are not applicable to   the Higher -Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n23 \n energy C -trap Dissociation  fragmentation ( HCD ) data produced at the other centers, but all of the \nother TCGA data could yield a greater number of  peptide sequence matches with the use of \nadditional search engines that employ strategies orthogonal to that of MS -GF+.   \nTCGA Proteome Data Sets are a Rich Resource for Bioinformatics  Investigations  \nThe composite data sets for e ach TCGA sample experiment are larger and more \ncomprehensive than any previous  proteomic investigations of cancer tumors.  Consequently, they \nare useful for future bioinformatics analyses on many levels. Additional processing is planned \nboth at NIST/DCC an d at each Proteome Characterization Center .  For example, patient -specific \ngenome data will be used to search all data sets for tumor specific peptides.  At the same time, \nemploying second or third search engines may enhance peptide sequence detection.  Th ere are \nlarge numbers of unidentified MS2 spectra from abundant components (30% or more of the total \nacquired spectra) that are consistently observed in samples, and these require invest igation and \ncharacterization.  NIST libraries of frequently encountered, unidentified mass spectra  will aide \nfuture research  by rapidly recognition  of novel components vs. commonly encountered artifacts.  \nAs with any data analysis, the CPTAC data require careful consideration of the \nassumptions and uncertainties inherent within the analysis methods and measurements.  The \nNIST team is responsible for ensuring that biological and clinical conclusions drawn from CDAP \ndata are based on a consistently high level of proteomics data quality.  \n ",

The command line (CL) version is recommended for those that have some experience with command line tools in cases where the user needs to download a large volume data in an organized manner. For users that prefer a graphical interface, the PDC Data Download Client User Interface (UI) is available.\n\nSystem requirements\n\nOS: Linux (Ubuntu 14.x or later, CentOS 7), OS X (10.9 Mavericks or\u202f< 12.0\u202f), or Windows (7 or later)\n\nPlease delete any previous instances of the download client before downloading a newer version.\n\nDownloading the PDC Data Download Client\n\nBinary Distributions: The following zip folders contain both the Command Line & UI versions for each OS.\n\nPlatform PDC Data Download Client Command Line & User Interface Linux pdc-client_v1.0.8_Ubuntu_x64.zip OS X pdc-client_v1.0.8_OSX_x64.zip Windows pdc-client_v1.0.8_Windows_x64.zip\n\nRelease Notes\n\nPlease click here for the release notes of the Download Client.\n\nKnown Issues\n\nThere is a limit of 10 download attempts per individual file. This limit includes the retries that are automatically attempted by the download client. The current error message does not reflect this (CL).\n\nOn this page:\n\nObtaining a File manifest for Data download\n\nData Download Client User Interface (UI)\n\nData Download Client Command Line\n\nObtaining a File manifest for Data download\n\nIn order to download files using either the UI or command line version of the PDC data download client, you will need to have a file manifest downloaded from the PDC portal. To generate a file manifest, go to the \u2018Explore\u2019 page, and apply filters to isolate the study or group of studies you want to download files from. Navigate to the files tab and select the files you wish to download. You can use the dropdown in the upper left corner to select all files available for the studies you have filtered by choosing the \u2018select all pages\u2019 option. With the desired files selected, choose either the CSV or TSV option of the \u2018Export File Manifest\u2019 feature. Both formats are supported by the PDC data download client. Place the downloaded manifest in the same directory as the download client executable, or in another known location.\n\nIn order to download files using either the UI or command line version of the PDC data download client, you will need to have a file manifest downloaded from the PDC portal.

Place the downloaded manifest in the same directory as the download client executable, or in another known location.\n\nNote: The PDC data download client will reject manifests older than one week (168 hours), as the download URLs will no longer be valid.\n\nData Download Client User Interface (UI)\n\nInstallation Prerequisites\n\nFirst, begin by clicking on the link in the \u201cPDC Data Download Client Command Line & User Interface\u201d column of the \u201cBinary Distributions\u201d table above that corresponds to your operating system type. The zip folder contains both the CL & UI versions. To use the UI version, unzip the folder that contains 'UI' in the file name and follow the installation instructions below. Note the system requirements displayed above the table. If your particular operating system does not meet the version requirements, the download client UI may not run. To view operating system version on Windows, go to the start menu, search for and select \u2018System Information\u2019. To view the operating system version on Mac, navigate to the apple menu and select \u2018About This Mac\u2019. Methods for viewing the Linux version will depend on the distribution but opening the command prompt and using the \u2018lsb-release\u2019 command will display version information on common Debian-based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu.   Clicking on a link will begin the download of the Zip (.zip extension) file containing the download client. Depending on your operating system version, it may be necessary to install an archive manager to extract the archive\u2019s files. Most current operating system versions will have tools for managing Zip files built in.\n\nOS X Installation Instructions\n\nOn OS X, the Zip file will contain a DMG file which can be run to install the PDC Data download client UI. Navigate to the downloaded Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default. Extracting the file (double clicking on the Zip file or right-click -> \u201copen with\u201d -> \u201cZip file utility\u201d) will produce the DMG file. Double click the DMG file to install the PDC download client. You will be prompted to move the client to your \u2018Applications\u2019 folder during the installation process. If you run into an error such as 'macOS cannot verify the developer of \u201cpdcdownloadclient\u201d. Are you sure you want to open it?', please navigate to 'Security preferences' -> 'Security and Privacy' settings of your MAC machine and choose an option to run the app. Now you can run the PDC download client UI as you would any other application.\n\nWindows installation Instructions\n\nOn Windows, the Zip file will contain all the necessary components to run the UI client. Navigate to the Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default. Note that if you double click on the file, it will open the Zip file; however, you must extract all files to run the client. You may extract the files to any folder you would like. To do this right-click the Zip file and choose \u201cExtract All\u201d, or open the Zip file, select all the files, and move them to the destination folder by dragging them or copying and pasting them. Open the extracted folder and look for the \u2018pdcDownloadClient.exe\u2019 executable file; double clicking this file will open the PDC Data Download Client UI. If you run into an error such as 'Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk', please click on 'More info' and choose 'Run anyway'. You may create a shortcut to the executable file for easy access in the future.\n\nUbuntu Installation Instructions\n\nOn Linux, the Zip file will contain an AppImage file which can be run to install the PDC Data download client UI. Navigate to the downloaded Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default. Extracting the file (double clicking on the Zip file or right-click -> \u201copen with\u201d -> \u201cZip file utility\u201d) will produce the executable file. Double click the AppImage file to install the PDC download client. In some cases where you\u2019re unable to run the app, you might have to install the \u201clibfuse2\u201d package which is an interface used by the Linux kernel for userspace programs to export a filesystem to the kernel. For installing it, please open the command prompt and run \u201csudo apt-get install -y libfuse2\u201d. Now you can run the PDC download client UI as you would any other application.\n\nOn Linux, the Zip file will contain an AppImage file which can be run to install the PDC Data download client UI. Navigate to the downloaded Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default.

For installing it, please open the command prompt and run \u201csudo apt-get install -y libfuse2\u201d. Now you can run the PDC download client UI as you would any other application.\n\nSome Ubuntu users might run into the error \u201dNo application installed for AppImage application bundle files\u201d while trying to run the client. In order to resolve this error, right-click on the extracted AppImage file -> Properties -> Permissions -> select \u201dAllow Executing File as a Program\u201d. Then try running it again by double-clicking or right-click -> Open. This will resolve the issue and you'll be able to run the application.\n\nBasic Usage\n\nExecuting the PDC data download client UI by running the standalone executable will open the UI. Here, you may start the download process by selecting a file manifest. Clicking the \u2018Select Manifest File\u2019 button will allow you to browse for the manifest.\n\nExecuting the PDC data download client UI by running the standalone executable will open the UI. Here, you may start the download process by selecting a file manifest. Clicking the \u2018Select Manifest File\u2019 button will allow you to browse for the manifest.\n\nTo select the files you wish to download, click the checkbox in the leftmost column of the table next to the desired file. Clicking the checkbox in the top left of the table will select all files present in the manifest. Once you have selected the files you wish to download, click the \u2018Download\u2019 button on the bottom right to begin downloading your files. Files that have been downloaded successfully will appear in the \u2018Completed\u2019 tab. In the event you either cancel the download by clicking the \u2018Stop\u2019 button or if the download fails, the files left to download will appear in the \u2018Failed\u2019 or \u2018Stopped\u2019 tab. By navigating to those tabs, you may select the remaining files and resume the download. 'Skipped' tab lists previously downloaded files that already exist in the download path.\n\nNote: When exiting the client, any failed or stopped downloads will remain visible the next time the PDC Download Client UI is run. Uploading a new manifest, or hitting the \u2018Clear Cache\u2019 button will reset these tabs.\n\nConfiguring the download client\n\nClicking on the \u2018Settings\u2019 tab will allow you to configure various options for downloading your data.\n\nThe \u2018Destination Folder\u2019 field along with the 'Browse' button allows you to enter the file path to which your files will be downloaded. If the file path or folder that is entered cannot be found a warning will appear when hitting \u2018Save Settings\u2019 indicating that the file path is not valid.\n\nThe \u2018Use PDC default directory structure\u2019 option specifies whether to use the default directory structure:\n\nThe \u2018Use PDC default directory structure\u2019 option specifies whether to use the default directory structure:\n\nPDC Study ID -> Study Version Number -> Data Category -> Run Metadata ID (if applicable) -> File Format or an alternative structure, where each file is given its own folder in the parent directory.\n\nThe \u2018Calculate Inbound Segment and check Md5sum on Restart\u2019 and \u2018Check Md5sum after Download\u2019 options are optional features that ensures file integrity is maintained.\n\nOther parameters you may configure are present in the \u2018Advanced Settings\u2019. These settings share their behavior with the optional arguments for the PDC Data Download Command Line tool.\n\nData Download Client Command Line\n\nBasic Usage\n\nOnce the file manifest has been exported you are ready to download files using the command line tool. Executing the PDC data download client without any parameters will show the available base commands and Note: Trying to use the executable directly by double-clicking will only cause a window to appear briefly. The PDC Data Download Client can only be run using the command-line. Select 'Command Prompt' on Microsoft Windows or 'Terminal' in OS X or Ubuntu to open a new command-line instance.\n\nOnce the file manifest has been exported you are ready to download files using the command line tool.

Select 'Command Prompt' on Microsoft Windows or 'Terminal' in OS X or Ubuntu to open a new command-line instance.\n\nNote: For a Windows machine, please install a tool equivalent of Git Bash to run Unix commands.\n\nThe path to the file manifest is included in the download command with the inclusion of the\n\nm or\n\n--manifest followed by the location and name of the manifest\n\nNavigate to the directory where the binary and manifest files are present. (Eg Downloads directory: /home/Users/Downloads)\n\ncd /home/Users/Downloads\n\nRun the following command\n\n./pdc-client.exe download -m PDC_file_manifest_05032022_145231.tsv\n\nDirectory Structure of Downloaded Files\n\nThe default behavior of the PDC data download client is to download files into a directory tree with the following format to the directory in which the client was run:\n\nThe default behavior of the PDC data download client is to download files into a directory tree with the following format to the directory in which the client was run:\n\nPDC Study ID -> Study Version Number -> Data Category -> Run Metadata ID (if applicable) -> File Format\n\nUsers may also choose an alternative format that downloads each file into its own separate directory by providing the\n\n--not-retain-pdc-download-path option.\n\n./pdc-client.exe download -m PDC_file_manifest_05032022_145231.tsv --not-retain-pdc-download-path\n\nWhen using this option it is possible to specify an alternative directory in which to download the files. Provide the\n\n--dir followed by the desired file path. This will place all downloaded files in the specified location without creating individual folders for each file. The\n\n--dir option is only available when used in combination with the\n\n--not-retain-pdc-download-path option. If\n\n--not-retain-pdc-download-path is not specified, the\n\n--dir option is ignored, and files will be downloaded in the current directory in the standard PDC download path.\n\n./pdc-client.exe download -m PDC_file_manifest_05032022_145231.tsv --not-retain-pdc-download-path --dir /Example/Directory/Path\n\nNote: The specified directory must be created prior to running the command; the client will not create the directory itself and an error will be thrown if the directory cannot be found.\n\nResuming a Failed Download\n\nIn the event a file fails to download, a file with the '.partial' extension will appear in the destination folder. To complete the download of these files, repeat the download command with the same destination path and a manifest containing the failed/missing files; the PDC Data Download Client will identify and download any missing and partial files. Files present in the manifest that were successfully downloaded will be automatically skipped.\n\nIn the event a file fails to download, a file with the '.partial' extension will appear in the destination folder.

Files present in the manifest that were successfully downloaded will be automatically skipped.\n\nNote: The PDC allows for a maximum of 10 retries for a given file within a 24-hour period. The number of retries to be automatically attempted can be specified with the\n\n--retry-amount option, or the automatic retries can be disabled with the\n\n--no-auto-retry option. The client will notify you when the limit has been reached for a particular file.\n\nFile Integrity Checks\n\nEvery file distributed by the PDC has had its MD5 sum calculated; this value can be found in the file manifests. By default, the PDC Data Download client will calculate the MD5 of any downloaded files and verify it against the value in the manifest. This ensures the downloaded files and the version stored by the PDC are identical, and no file corruption has occurred.

Place the downloaded manifest in the same directory as the download client executable, or in another known location.\n\nNote: The PDC data download client will reject manifests older than one week (168 hours), as the download URLs will no longer be valid.\n\nData Download Client User Interface (UI)\n\nInstallation Prerequisites\n\nFirst, begin by clicking on the link in the \u201cPDC Data Download Client Command Line & User Interface\u201d column of the \u201cBinary Distributions\u201d table above that corresponds to your operating system type. The zip folder contains both the CL & UI versions. To use the UI version, unzip the folder that contains 'UI' in the file name and follow the installation instructions below. Note the system requirements displayed above the table. If your particular operating system does not meet the version requirements, the download client UI may not run. To view operating system version on Windows, go to the start menu, search for and select \u2018System Information\u2019. To view the operating system version on Mac, navigate to the apple menu and select \u2018About This Mac\u2019. Methods for viewing the Linux version will depend on the distribution but opening the command prompt and using the \u2018lsb-release\u2019 command will display version information on common Debian-based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu.   Clicking on a link will begin the download of the Zip (.zip extension) file containing the download client. Depending on your operating system version, it may be necessary to install an archive manager to extract the archive\u2019s files. Most current operating system versions will have tools for managing Zip files built in.\n\nOS X Installation Instructions\n\nOn OS X, the Zip file will contain a DMG file which can be run to install the PDC Data download client UI. Navigate to the downloaded Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default. Extracting the file (double clicking on the Zip file or right-click -> \u201copen with\u201d -> \u201cZip file utility\u201d) will produce the DMG file. Double click the DMG file to install the PDC download client. You will be prompted to move the client to your \u2018Applications\u2019 folder during the installation process. If you run into an error such as 'macOS cannot verify the developer of \u201cpdcdownloadclient\u201d. Are you sure you want to open it?', please navigate to 'Security preferences' -> 'Security and Privacy' settings of your MAC machine and choose an option to run the app. Now you can run the PDC download client UI as you would any other application.\n\nWindows installation Instructions\n\nOn Windows, the Zip file will contain all the necessary components to run the UI client. Navigate to the Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default. Note that if you double click on the file, it will open the Zip file; however, you must extract all files to run the client. You may extract the files to any folder you would like. To do this right-click the Zip file and choose \u201cExtract All\u201d, or open the Zip file, select all the files, and move them to the destination folder by dragging them or copying and pasting them. Open the extracted folder and look for the \u2018pdcDownloadClient.exe\u2019 executable file; double clicking this file will open the PDC Data Download Client UI. If you run into an error such as 'Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk', please click on 'More info' and choose 'Run anyway'. You may create a shortcut to the executable file for easy access in the future.\n\nUbuntu Installation Instructions\n\nOn Linux, the Zip file will contain an AppImage file which can be run to install the PDC Data download client UI. Navigate to the downloaded Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default. Extracting the file (double clicking on the Zip file or right-click -> \u201copen with\u201d -> \u201cZip file utility\u201d) will produce the executable file. Double click the AppImage file to install the PDC download client. In some cases where you\u2019re unable to run the app, you might have to install the \u201clibfuse2\u201d package which is an interface used by the Linux kernel for userspace programs to export a filesystem to the kernel. For installing it, please open the command prompt and run \u201csudo apt-get install -y libfuse2\u201d. Now you can run the PDC download client UI as you would any other application.\n\nOn Linux, the Zip file will contain an AppImage file which can be run to install the PDC Data download client UI.

This will help users determine if this platform is the right data source for their specific needs, such as identifying drug targets, exploring disease associations, or accessing drug information.",
            "summary": "The Open Targets Platform (OT) is a comprehensive tool designed to support the systematic identification and prioritization of potential therapeutic drug targets. It integrates publicly available datasets to build and score target-disease associations, assisting researchers and pharmaceutical companies in drug target identification and prioritization. The platform is freely available and updated bi-monthly, ensuring users have access to the latest data and insights in the field of drug discovery and development.\n\nThe platform provides a wide range of data, including detailed annotations about targets, diseases, phenotypes, and drugs. Users can search for specific targets, diseases, and drugs, and view associations between them. For example, users can explore data related to specific genes like PTEN and PTGS2, diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and drugs like LYRICA and HUMIRA. This makes the platform a valuable resource for understanding the relationships between different biological entities and their implications for therapeutic development.\n\nIn addition to its search functionalities, the Open Targets Platform offers several other features. Users can access platform documentation to get started, download datasets for more extensive analyses, and utilize the GraphQL API for graphical queries across the platform's knowledge graph. The API is optimized for single queries, but users can also perform more programmatic or systematic analyses using dataset downloads or the Google BigQuery instance. The platform also provides access to release notes, platform publications, and a community forum where users can discuss and share information.\n\nThe platform's interface includes a header with navigation links to documentation, data downloads, the API, and the community forum. There is also a search bar for quick access to specific targets, diseases, and drugs, and a footer with additional links to the community forum, privacy notice, terms of use, and information about the platform's partners and social media channels. The platform is supported by several partner organizations, including EMBL-EBI, Genentech, GSK, MSD, Pfizer, Sanofi, and the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\n\nOverall, the Open Targets Platform is a robust and versatile resource for researchers and professionals in the field of drug discovery, providing essential data and tools for identifying and prioritizing therapeutic targets."

spring/summer, and we highly recommend delaying any serious development against it until we release the new version. However, if you are interested in working with our API, we would love to hear from you, especially as we work out what capabilities we will offer. We would be happy to work with you during our development, and to bring your group on as beta testers when we get closer to release.\n\nquerygetReturns all column names and definitions for schemapostExecute Subject querypostExecute Subject Files querypostExecute Subjects Counts querypostExecute Subjects File Counts querypostExecute Research Subject querypostExecute ResearchSubject Files querypostExecute ResearchSubjects Counts querypostExecute ResearchSubjects File Counts querypostExecute Specimens querypostExecute Specimen Files querypostExecute Specimen Counts querypostExecute Specimen File Counts querypostExecute Diagnosis querypostExecute Diagnosis Counts querypostExecute Mutation querypostExecute Mutation Counts querypostExecute Treatments querypostExecute Treatments Counts querypostReturns all unique valuespostReturns counts of the DCSpostReturns a list of files given a boolean querypostExecute File Counts querymetagetCDA statusgetDescription of latest datasetgetList descriptions of all available datasetsAPI docs by RedoclyCDA API (3.2.0)Download OpenAPI specification:Download  License: Apache 2.0 API definition for the CDA\nqueryRetrieve the data stored in the CDA.\nReturns all column names and definitions for schema Return columnNames for schema along with their descriptions\nResponses200 columns response\nget/api/v1/columnshttps://cancerdata.dsde-prod.broadinstitute.org/api/v1/columns Response samples 200Content typeapplication/jsonCopy Expand all  Collapse all {\"result\": [{ }]}Execute Subject query Execute a Subject query composed of conditions on columns combined with boolean operators.

This will help in determining if this data source is suitable for specific user queries related to canine cancer research data.",
            "summary": "The Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC) is a specialized platform designed to provide access to and facilitate the exploration of canine cancer research data. The primary purpose of the ICDC is to support researchers by offering a comprehensive repository of data related to various studies, cases, and samples of canine cancer. Users can filter, view, and download data, making it a valuable resource for those involved in veterinary oncology and comparative oncology research. The ICDC is part of the larger NCI Cancer Research Data Commons, which provides a broader range of cancer research data across species.\n\nThe ICDC website is structured with several key sections to aid in data navigation and exploration. The main navigation bar includes links to Home, Explore, Programs, Studies, Data, Resources, and About sections. Each section provides specific functionalities and information. For instance, the 'Explore' section allows users to delve into the data, while the 'Programs' and 'Studies' sections offer detailed information on various research programs and individual studies, respectively.\n\nUsers can manage their data files in the 'My Files' section, where they can view and organize files related to their research. The 'Filter By Cases' section provides extensive filtering options, allowing users to narrow down data by criteria such as Program, Study, Study Type, Biobank, Study Participation, Breed, Diagnosis, Primary Disease Site, Stage of Disease, Response to Treatment, Sex, and Neutered Status. This level of granularity ensures that researchers can find the specific data they need for their studies.\n\nThe website also features a data visualization section that displays information on Programs and Studies, Breed, Diagnosis, Stage of Disease, Sex, and File Type. This visual representation helps users quickly grasp the distribution and characteristics of the data. Additionally, there are tabs for Cases, Samples, Case Files, and Study Files, each providing detailed listings and options for data management.\n\nAction buttons on the website allow users to add files, view data in JBrowse (a genome browser), and download table contents as CSV files. Pagination controls are available to navigate through large datasets. The ICDC also supports GraphQL queries, enabling advanced users to write, validate, and test queries directly within the browser.\n\nOverall, the ICDC is a robust and user-friendly platform designed to support the needs of researchers in the field of canine cancer. It offers a wide range of data and tools to facilitate in-depth research and data analysis, making it an essential resource for anyone involved in this area of study."

Explorer enables analysis and interrogation of individual single cell data sets. This section describes Explorer's capabilities.\n\nJust getting started with the tool? We recommend going through these tutorials in order to learn how to use the tool.\n\nReturning for a quick refresh? We\u2019ve identified the key concepts below the tutorial so you can skim through and find what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nYou can follow along with any of these tutorials by launching an instance of the CELLxGENE Explorer with the Tabula Sapiens using this CELLxGENE Explorer link. For more information on Tabula Sapiens, you can refer to the preprint on biorxiv.\n\nCZ CELLxGENE Explorer Interface\n\nCELLxGENE Explorer's user interface organizes single cell data similarly to how it is organized in single cell data formats. The left hand side displays categorical and numerical sample metadata. The right hand side is a space for displaying features such as genes and gene sets. The center displays the embedding, where each cell is a point. UMAP and tSNE are common embeddings, which place cells based on their local distances in gene expression space. Cells from spatial data can also be displayed using each cell's (x, y) coordinates.\n\nKey Concepts: User Interface Explanation\n\nExamining Categorical Metadata\n\nCategorical metadata (such as tissue of origin or cell type) can be used in a number of ways within Explorer including coloring embedding plots (i.e. color UMAP by cell type), looking at cell counts, within a categorical metadata field, making selections of cells or viewing the interaction between different categorical metadata fields.\n\nKey Concepts: Categorical Metadata, Selecting Cells by Category (i.e. cell type), Interaction Between Categorical Metadata Fields\n\nFind Cells Where a Gene is Expressed\n\nNumerical metadata (such gene expression features or QC metrics such as number of genes) can be examined on the embedding plot and be used to filter and select cells. Additionally tools like the clip tool can give us control over how these attributes are displayed on the embedding plot.\n\nKey Concepts: Numerical Metadata, Cell Filtering and Selection, Interaction Between Numerical Metadata, Categorical Metadata Fields\n\nSelecting and Subsetting Cells\n\nExplorer allows for the complex selection of cells via selection directly on the embedding, gene expression cutoffs, and based on categorical metadata attributes.\n\nKey Concepts: Categorical Metadata Selection, Numerical Metadata Selection, Complex Selection (combining selection methods)\n\nCompare Expression of Multiple Genes\n\nExplorer allows you to compare the expression of multiple genes via bivariate plots.\n\nKey Concepts: Gene Expression, Co-expression, Cell Selection, Subsetting\n\nUsing Gene Sets to Learn About Cell Population Functional Characteristics\n\nExplorer allows you to examine groups of genes via the gene sets feature.\n\nKey Concepts: Gene Expression, Co-expression, Cell Selection, Subsetting\n\nListed below is a comma separated gene set list for use with this tutorial.\n\nACAA1, ACAA2, ACADL, ACADM, ACADS, ACADSB, ACADVL, ACAT1, ACAT2, ACOX1, ACOX3, ACSL1, ACSL3, ACSL4, ACSL5, ACSL6, ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C, ADH4, ADH5, ADH6, ADH7, ALDH1B1, ALDH2, ALDH3A2, ALDH7A1, ALDH9A1, CPT1A, CPT1B, CPT1C, CPT2, CYP4A11, CYP4A22, ECHS1, ECI1, ECI2, EHHADH, GCDH, HADH, HADHA, HADHB\n\nFind Marker Genes\n\nExplorer allows you to find marker genes between selected cell populations.\n\nKey Concepts: Gene Expression, Differential Expression, Cell Selection, Subsetting\n\nNote: You can find more information here about how our differential expression is calculated. In brief, we use a Welch's t-test. While we are aware that single cell data does not always meet the assumptions imposed by this test, we utilize it because it performs well at identifying the most differentially expressed genes, and this is what our feature returns.",

Q: Is there an association between alterations \nin a particular query gene and age? \nA: We can see that patients with mutations or \namplifications in EGFR tend to be older than \nthose with mutations in IDH1/IDH2 \nLink to this page Now we\u2019re going to go through all the other tabs and \nask some questions about alterations in IDH1 , IDH2  \nand EGFR  in the TCGA Lower-Grade Glioma study. \nNote: Depending on the data available for a \nparticular study, not all of the following tabs will be \npresent (e.g. a study without expression data will not \nhave a Co-expression tab) Cancer Types Summary \nHover over a bar to see \nadditional details. Histogram of the frequency of alterations in \neach gene for each detailed cancer type. \nQ: Are alterations in EGFR more frequent in a \nparticular subtype of glioma? \nA: Yes, astrocytoma appears to have a much \nhigher frequency of EGFR alteration than \noligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma. \nLink to this page Options to \ncustomize \nvisualization Plots for all \nqueried genes \ntogether and \neach individual \ngene are \navailable as \nseparate tabs. \nMutual Exclusivity \nAll pairwise \ncombinations of query \ngenes analyzed for \nmutual exclusivity or \nco-occurrence in the \nqueried samples.

On the next slide is a query for IDH1, IDH2, EGFR and \nTP53 in the TCGA LGG PanCan Atlas Dataset. What happens in a regular query? \nWhat happens in a regular query? \nThis query looks for samples with alterations in IDH1, IDH2, EGFR and TP53. We \ncan see that the presence of any of four different alterations (Amplification, Deep \nDeletion, Mutation or Structural Variant) define a sample as having an alteration in \na query gene. \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nBut how were those four types of alterations selected? How do we know if an \nalteration isn\u2019t present in the data or just isn\u2019t being examined in this query? \nFor example, are there samples with shallow deletions in any of the query genes? \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nIf you hover over a gene name, you can see the specific alterations which were \nincluded in the query: \u201cMUT\u201d, \u201cFUSION\u201d, \u201cAMP\u201d, \u201cHOMDEL\u201d. These are the default \nOQL options and will highlight any mutation, fusion/structural variant, amplification \nor homozygous/deep deletion in the query gene. \nNote: Not all studies have all datatypes, for example many studies do not have fusion/structural variant calls. \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nSo let\u2019s come back to this question: are there samples with shallow deletions in \nany of the query genes? \nShallow deletions were not included in the OQL for this query, so there may be \nshallow deletions affecting these genes, but we won\u2019t see them because the query \ndidn\u2019t look for them. \nWhat if we want to include shallow deletions? How do we do that? Let\u2019s learn how \nto use OQL! The Rules of OQL \nOQL uses keywords to define the \nalterations to include in a query. \nTo the right is a table defining the \ngeneral keywords (top) and the \nmodifiers which can be applied to \ncertain keywords (bottom). The \ncomplete specifications can be \nfound here. \nLink to this page Using OQL \nLet\u2019s re-create our initial query. On the left is the query as we ran it before. On the \nright are two different ways to write the exact same query using OQL. Using OQL \nThe general format for OQL is \u201cGENE: ALTERATION1 ALTERATION2 ...\u201d. But as \nshown in the bottom example, the \u201cDATATYPES\u201d command allows a user to select \nthe same set of alterations for multiple genes all at once. \nHere each gene is listed on its \nown line, followed by a colon \nand then the list of alterations. \nRather than writing the same alterations \nafter each gene, the \u201cDATATYPES\u201d \ncommand can be used to set the \nalterations for multiple genes at once. Using OQL \nNow let\u2019s adjust the default query. Let\u2019s look for gains in EGFR and shallow \ndeletions in TP53. Add \u201cGAIN\u201d \nand \u201cHETLOSS\u201d to the query: \nOncoPrint now includes gains in EGFR and shallow deletions in TP53: \nLink to this page Using OQL \nWhat if we want to look at IDH1 R132C mutations, but no other IDH1 alteration? \nWe can specify a specific \nmutation in OQL: \nWe then see that there are many fewer samples with mutations in IDH1 since we \nhave limited the query to the relatively rare R132C. \nLink to this page Using OQL \nWe can further refine the query by removing alteration types that are not \nbiologically relevant, like deep \ndeletions in IDH2 & EGFR: \nLink to this page \nOQL Example: \nBRCA1/2 inactivation in ovarian cancer OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLoss of BRCA1 is a common event in ovarian cancer. What percentage of \nsamples lose BRCA1? Let\u2019s run a query to find out: OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Looking at OncoPrint, we can see that 12% of cases have an alteration in each of \nBRCA1 and BRCA2. However, this includes amplifications, which will not result in \na loss of function. We can use OQL to make the query more specific. \nOQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nModify the query to include only \nmutations and deep deletions: \nOncoPrint now shows a more accurate estimate of the frequency of BRCA1/2 loss: \nLink to this page OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page However, mutations and deletions are not the only way to decrease the levels of \nfunctional protein in a cell. DNA methylation can lead to decreased mRNA \nexpression. We can use the \n\u201cPlots\u201d tab to examine the \nrelationship between DNA \nmethylation and gene \nexpression. Note that the \nlower right quadrant \ncontains samples with low \nexpression and high DNA \nmethylation. We can also \nuse OQL to identify these \nsamples. OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nModify the query to also include samples with decreased expression (don\u2019t forget to \nselect \u201cmRNA Expression\u201d in \nthe \u201cGenomics Profiles\u201d section): \nOncoPrint now shows a more accurate estimate of the frequency of BRCA1 loss: \nLink to this page OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Some mutations in the OncoPrint are variants of unknown significance. Recall from \nthe Single Study Query Tutorial  that mutations are annotated as \u201cputative drivers\u201d \nor \u201cunknown significance\u201d based on this settings menu in the header: OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nWe can further refine the query by only including those mutations which are \nputative drivers, as defined by the settings menu. We can do this by: \n-Adding _DRIVER to the MUT term in OQL. This will include only mutations that \nare putative drivers (see BRCA1 below) \n-Or, replace the entire OQL string with DRIVER. This will include mutations, \nfusions/structural variant and copy number changes that are putative drivers \n(see BRCA2 below) OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Compare the result of this latest query (top) with the previous query (bottom) and \nsee that the mutations of unknown significance are no longer present. OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page This study is one of the few in cBioPortal that includes germline mutations. We can \nmake one final adjustment to our query to ask a slightly different question: what \npercentage of samples have putative driver germline mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2? \nNote that the OQL for BRCA1 and BRCA2 are equivalent as the GERMLINE term \nonly applies to mutations. OQL Example: \nRTK pathway alterations OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nAlterations in RTK signaling pathway members are common in colorectal \nadenocarcinoma. What is the pattern of alterations across the different levels of the \nsignaling pathway? \nRecall that RTKs (e.g. EGFR, \nERBB2) activate RAS (KRAS, \nNRAS, HRAS) which in turn \nactivate RAF (BRAF, ARAF, \nRAF1) which in turn activate \nMEK (MAP2K1, MAP2K2). \nLet\u2019s query all of these genes: OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page We see here an overview of each individual gene in the pathway. However, it can \nbe informative to instead see each level of the pathway grouped together. OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page We can use gene tracks to group genes together in the OncoPrint. The format is \n[\u201coptional track name\u201d GENE1 GENE2 \u2026 ]: \nOQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page Gene tracks can be combined with other OQL \nterms, either using the DATATYPES command \nas shown here, or attaching OQL to genes \nwithin the square brackets. \nNow we can clearly visualize the pattern of mutual exclusivity of driver alterations at \neach level of the pathway. OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nGene tracks can also be expanded to see tracks for individual genes. To expand, \nclick the    symbol next to the track. \nNote that OncoPrint, Mutual Exclusivity and Group Comparison are the only tabs that currently \nsupport gene tracks. All other tabs show individual genes rather than gene tracks. \nLink to this page Questions? \nCheck out the OQL specification , \nor our other tutorials, \nor email us at: \ncbioportal@googlegroups.com \n\ncBioPortal%20Tutorial%204%20Virtual%20Studies:\ncBioPortal Tutorial #4: \nVirtual Studies \nCreate and save your own custom study comprised \nof samples from existing studies \nLast update: December 23, 2021 Tutorial Objectives \n\u25cfExplain what virtual studies are and how to create them \n\u25cfDelineate the different features available when a user is or is not logged in \n\u25cfShow how to log in Virtual Study Overview \nWhat is a Virtual Study? \nA virtual study is a custom study comprised of samples from one or more existing \nstudies. \nWhy is a virtual study useful? \nThe virtual study feature allows you to define a custom cohort of samples that fit \nyour specific genomic or clinical criteria of interest. These samples can be a \nsubset of the data available in an existing study, or result from the combination of \nmultiple existing studies. This cohort of samples can then be queried or explored \njust like a traditional study, and can be returned to at a later date or shared with a \ncollaborator. In this tutorial, we will create a virtual study \ncomprised of a subset of samples from two existing \nTCGA glioma studies. \nWe begin by selecting the studies of interest and \nviewing them in the Study Summary page. Creating a virtual study: Selecting studies \n1. Use the search \nbox to find the \nstudies of interest \n2. Select the studies \nof interest \n3. Click \u201cExplore \nSelected Studies\u201d \nLink to this page Creating a virtual study: Study summary page \nClick on the       to see \nthe list of studies \nThis is the same Study Summary page that you see for a single study, but now \nwith data from 2 studies. \nLink to this page Creating a virtual study: Study summary page \nUse this table to \nselect samples with \nIDH1 mutations \n(Click the check box in the \u201c#\u201d \ncolumn, then \u201cSelect Samples\u201d at \nthe bottom of the table) In this example, we will additionally filter to samples with mutations in IDH1. \nLink to this page We are now ready to create our virtual study. \nWhat you see will differ slightly depending on if you \nare logged in or not. The next two slides show what \nthe virtual study button looks like in each scenario. \nVirtual study button (not logged in) \nEnter a name for your \nvirtual study (optional) \nClick on the link to open \nyour virtual study, or \nclick \u201cCopy\u201d to copy the \nURL to your clipboard. Text box pre-filled with \na description of the \nstudies contributing \nsamples and filters \napplied to the samples. \nYou can edit this text. \nList of studies \ncontributing to samples \nwith links to the study \nsummary for each Click here to create and \nshare your virtual study \nLink to this page \nVirtual study button (logged in) \nWhen you save a study, it is added to the \nhomepage, at the top of the study list \nunder \u201cMy Virtual Studies\u201d. Clicking \n\u201cQuery\u201d brings you to the query selector \nwith your new virtual study pre-selected. \nThe \u201cSave\u201d button only \nappears when you are \nlogged in. The \u201cShare\u201d button \nworks exactly the same \nas when not logged in \nLink to this page \nWhether or not you are logged in, let\u2019s continue \non to view this new virtual study. Virtual study: Study summary page \nWe can now see the study summary page for our newly created virtual study. You \ncan now explore these samples or run a query, just like with a traditional study. \nRemember that while making this study we filtered down to IDH1 mutant samples, but the non-mutant \nsamples were still present. Now, those samples without mutations are completely gone. \nClick on the       to see the \ndescription of this virtual study \nLink to this page Logging in to cBioPortal: \nIf you use a private instance of cBioPortal, you might \nalready go through an authentication process \n(through your university, for example). If so, there is \nnothing else you need to do. \nBut if you don\u2019t normally log in, then let\u2019s go through \nhow this works. Logging in \nLink to this page \nClick here \nLogging in \nWe use Google and Microsoft for authentication. Sign in with any Google or \nMicrosoft account. Logging in \nLink to this page \nyour email address \nHere\u2019s the virtual \nstudy I made This is what you see \nwhen you log in Virtual Study Authentication Questions \nIs it necessary to log in to use virtual studies? \nNo. A user that has not logged in can create virtual studies and run queries in \nthose studies (by using the query box on the study summary page). Links to virtual \nstudies are permanent, so you can save the link on your computer and come back \nto it anytime, or share it with others. \nIf I do log in, what additional functionality do I gain? \nIf you log in, you gain the ability to save your virtual study to the list of existing \nstudies on the homepage. This makes a virtual study functionally the same as any \nother study: you can access your virtual studies in the query builder and you can \ncombine an existing virtual study with any other study to create a new virtual \nstudy.

Q: Is there an association between alterations \nin a particular query gene and age? \nA: We can see that patients with mutations or \namplifications in EGFR tend to be older than \nthose with mutations in IDH1/IDH2 \nLink to this page Now we\u2019re going to go through all the other tabs and \nask some questions about alterations in IDH1 , IDH2  \nand EGFR  in the TCGA Lower-Grade Glioma study. \nNote: Depending on the data available for a \nparticular study, not all of the following tabs will be \npresent (e.g. a study without expression data will not \nhave a Co-expression tab) Cancer Types Summary \nHover over a bar to see \nadditional details. Histogram of the frequency of alterations in \neach gene for each detailed cancer type. \nQ: Are alterations in EGFR more frequent in a \nparticular subtype of glioma? \nA: Yes, astrocytoma appears to have a much \nhigher frequency of EGFR alteration than \noligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma. \nLink to this page Options to \ncustomize \nvisualization Plots for all \nqueried genes \ntogether and \neach individual \ngene are \navailable as \nseparate tabs. \nMutual Exclusivity \nAll pairwise \ncombinations of query \ngenes analyzed for \nmutual exclusivity or \nco-occurrence in the \nqueried samples. On the OncoPrint tab we could \nsee visually that alterations in \nthese three query genes tended to \nbe mutually exclusive. Here we \ncan address that same question \nwith a statistical analysis. \nA positive value here suggests that alterations \nin these genes co-occur in the same samples, \nwhile a negative value suggests that \nalterations in these genes are mutually \nexclusive and occur in different samples. \nlog2(                                               ) odds of alteration in B given alteration in A \nodds of alteration in B given lack of alteration in A \nLink to this page Click on any \ncolumn header to \nsort.

The Furin-like domain \nalso appears to be frequently mutated. Note \nthat these are also statistical hotspots \naccording to the OncoKB & Cancer Hotspots \ntracks and are all located in the extracellular \ndomain according to the Topology tracks. \nLink to this page Mutations \nQ: The mutations in IDH1 appear to be highly recurrent. \nAre these mutations known hotspots? Known oncogenic \ndrivers? Biomarkers for any drugs? \nA: Look at the annotation tracks below the lollipop plot and \nthe Annotation column in the table. Each mutation is \nannotated against 4 different databases with information \nabout recurrence, oncogenicity and drugability. \n     This mutation is in \nMy Cancer Genome .\n        This mutation is annotated in \nCIViC .

Co-Expression \nQ: Several genes on chr7 show high expression correlation with \nEGFR within this cohort (see table on the left). Why might that be? \nA: EGFR is also located on chr7 and is frequently gained in some \nsubtypes of glioma which could explain these correlated increases in \nexpression. This can be further explored in the \u201cCN Segments\u201d tab. \nLink to this page Comparison \nThis tab enables the comparison of all available data types between \nsamples with or without alterations in the query genes. This tab replaces \nand enhances the old \u201cEnrichments\u201d tab. \nThe Comparison tab is the same as the Group Comparison functionality \nthat is accessible from Study View. See the Group Comparison Tutorial  \nfor more details about the functionality of this tab. \nBy default, the \u201cAltered\u201d (one or more \nalterations in one or more query genes) \nand \u201cUnaltered\u201d (no alterations in any \nquery gene) groups are selected. Groups can be toggled on or off by \nclicking on them them. Analyses will \nupdate as the selections change. \nAdditional groups (deselected \nby default) correspond to each \ntrack shown in OncoPrint. \nLink to this page Comparison: Overlap \nThe Overlap subtab shows samples or patients \nthat may overlap among the selected groups. \nSelect one or more regions in the overlap \nplot to create a new group. If you are \nlogged in, this new group can be saved \nto your profile for future use. Saved \ngroups can be found under the \u201cGroups\u201d \nbutton in Study View. \nLink to this page Comparison: Survival \nLink to this page Select among \ndifferent outcome \nmeasures. Options \nhere depend on \ndata availability for \nthe study. The Survival subtab replaces the old \u201cSurvival\u201d \ntab. This subtab will only be visible if outcome data \nis available for the selected study. \nNote: These plots reflect \ndata as provided by the \nstudy. We do not perform \nany additional processing. \nQ: Do patients with alterations in \nIDH1 have different outcomes \ncompared to patients with \nalterations EGFR? \nA: Patients with alterations in IDH1 \nhave significantly better OS than \npatients with alterations in EGFR. Comparison: Clinical \nLink to this page Click on a clinical \nattribute to visualize \nthe data in the plot \non the right. The Clinical subtab compares all available clinical \ndata among the selected groups. Comparison: Molecular Profiles \nLink to this page The molecular profiles \nsubtabs replace the old \n\u201cEnrichments\u201d tab. \nThese analyses ask whether \nGenomic Alterations \n(mutations/copy-number \nalterations) or mRNA \nexpression or protein \nexpression in a particular \ngene is enriched in one of the \nselected groups. These, and \nadditional subtabs like \nMicrobiome Signature, will be \nvisible depending on the data \navailable for each study. Comparison: Molecular Profiles \nClick the checkbox next to a gene name and then click \nthis button to re-run the query with a gene added. Select sample-level or \npatient-level analysis \nClick on any column \nheader to sort. Hover \nover the column name for \nmore details about how \nvalues are calculated. Hover over a \ndot to see the \ngene name Select which types of \nalterations to include \nin the analysis \nLink to this page Comparison \nQ: Alterations in IDH1, IDH2 \nand EGFR are mutually \nexclusive but some samples \nhave alterations in none of \nthese genes. Do samples \nwithout IDH1, IDH2 or EGFR \nalterations commonly have \ngenomic alterations in one or \nmore other genes? \nA: Alterations in NF1 are \nsignificantly mutually exclusive \nwith alterations in IDH1, IDH2 \nand EGFR (see table). Try \nadding NF1 to the query (check \nthe box next to NF1 and then \nclick \u201cAdd checked genes to \nquery\u201d) and examine the \nOncoPrint and the Mutual \nExclusivity tabs. Notice the distribution of \nsamples with NF1 \nmutations relative to \nsamples with query \ngene alterations. CN Segments \nView copy number for each sample at each query \ngene via the Integrated Genomics Viewer  (IGV). \nClick      for track settings, \nincluding expanding the height \nof each sample (see below) Plots for each gene appear on a separate tab. Toggle track labels, a vertical line \nmarking the center of the viewing screen, \nand a vertical line that moves with your \ncursor.

Link to this page Example 3: Run the query \nExample 3: OncoPrint \nLink to this page In general, mutations in these genes are \nmutually exclusive. However, there\u2019s one case \nwith driver mutations in both KRAS and NRAS. \nLet\u2019s look at that patient in greater detail by \nclicking on the patient ID (\u201cTCGA-B5-A0JV\u201d). \nExample 3: Patient View \n3. Could this be related to \ndifferences in clonality? Perhaps the \nPIK3CA mutation is clonal while the \nNRAS & KRAS mutations are in two \ndistinct subclones. If that theory is \ncorrect, we would expect to see \nother mutations with similar variant \nallele frequencies. Indeed,we can \nsee that is true by looking at the \nhistogram of variant allele frequency. 2. Note that all three genes are \ndiploid, so the differences are unlikely \nto arise from copy number alteration. \nLink to this page 1. Look at the Allele Freq column for each mutation. NRAS \nQ61K (19%) and KRAS G12D (21%) have similar variant \nallele frequencies, but PIK3CA E542K is twice as high (38%). Summary of Example 3 : Using Patient View, we \ncan infer the clonality of mutations and understand \nhow two mutations, which are usually mutually \nexclusive, can be present in the same tumor sample. \nIn this case, the KRAS and NRAS mutations appear \nto be present in two distinct subclones of a single \ntumor.

On the next slide is a query for IDH1, IDH2, EGFR and \nTP53 in the TCGA LGG PanCan Atlas Dataset. What happens in a regular query? \nWhat happens in a regular query? \nThis query looks for samples with alterations in IDH1, IDH2, EGFR and TP53. We \ncan see that the presence of any of four different alterations (Amplification, Deep \nDeletion, Mutation or Structural Variant) define a sample as having an alteration in \na query gene. \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nBut how were those four types of alterations selected? How do we know if an \nalteration isn\u2019t present in the data or just isn\u2019t being examined in this query? \nFor example, are there samples with shallow deletions in any of the query genes? \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nIf you hover over a gene name, you can see the specific alterations which were \nincluded in the query: \u201cMUT\u201d, \u201cFUSION\u201d, \u201cAMP\u201d, \u201cHOMDEL\u201d. These are the default \nOQL options and will highlight any mutation, fusion/structural variant, amplification \nor homozygous/deep deletion in the query gene. \nNote: Not all studies have all datatypes, for example many studies do not have fusion/structural variant calls. \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nSo let\u2019s come back to this question: are there samples with shallow deletions in \nany of the query genes? \nShallow deletions were not included in the OQL for this query, so there may be \nshallow deletions affecting these genes, but we won\u2019t see them because the query \ndidn\u2019t look for them. \nWhat if we want to include shallow deletions? How do we do that? Let\u2019s learn how \nto use OQL! The Rules of OQL \nOQL uses keywords to define the \nalterations to include in a query. \nTo the right is a table defining the \ngeneral keywords (top) and the \nmodifiers which can be applied to \ncertain keywords (bottom). The \ncomplete specifications can be \nfound here. \nLink to this page Using OQL \nLet\u2019s re-create our initial query. On the left is the query as we ran it before. On the \nright are two different ways to write the exact same query using OQL. Using OQL \nThe general format for OQL is \u201cGENE: ALTERATION1 ALTERATION2 ...\u201d. But as \nshown in the bottom example, the \u201cDATATYPES\u201d command allows a user to select \nthe same set of alterations for multiple genes all at once. \nHere each gene is listed on its \nown line, followed by a colon \nand then the list of alterations. \nRather than writing the same alterations \nafter each gene, the \u201cDATATYPES\u201d \ncommand can be used to set the \nalterations for multiple genes at once. Using OQL \nNow let\u2019s adjust the default query. Let\u2019s look for gains in EGFR and shallow \ndeletions in TP53. Add \u201cGAIN\u201d \nand \u201cHETLOSS\u201d to the query: \nOncoPrint now includes gains in EGFR and shallow deletions in TP53: \nLink to this page Using OQL \nWhat if we want to look at IDH1 R132C mutations, but no other IDH1 alteration? \nWe can specify a specific \nmutation in OQL: \nWe then see that there are many fewer samples with mutations in IDH1 since we \nhave limited the query to the relatively rare R132C. \nLink to this page Using OQL \nWe can further refine the query by removing alteration types that are not \nbiologically relevant, like deep \ndeletions in IDH2 & EGFR: \nLink to this page \nOQL Example: \nBRCA1/2 inactivation in ovarian cancer OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLoss of BRCA1 is a common event in ovarian cancer. What percentage of \nsamples lose BRCA1? Let\u2019s run a query to find out: OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Looking at OncoPrint, we can see that 12% of cases have an alteration in each of \nBRCA1 and BRCA2. However, this includes amplifications, which will not result in \na loss of function. We can use OQL to make the query more specific. \nOQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nModify the query to include only \nmutations and deep deletions: \nOncoPrint now shows a more accurate estimate of the frequency of BRCA1/2 loss: \nLink to this page OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page However, mutations and deletions are not the only way to decrease the levels of \nfunctional protein in a cell. DNA methylation can lead to decreased mRNA \nexpression. We can use the \n\u201cPlots\u201d tab to examine the \nrelationship between DNA \nmethylation and gene \nexpression. Note that the \nlower right quadrant \ncontains samples with low \nexpression and high DNA \nmethylation. We can also \nuse OQL to identify these \nsamples. OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nModify the query to also include samples with decreased expression (don\u2019t forget to \nselect \u201cmRNA Expression\u201d in \nthe \u201cGenomics Profiles\u201d section): \nOncoPrint now shows a more accurate estimate of the frequency of BRCA1 loss: \nLink to this page OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Some mutations in the OncoPrint are variants of unknown significance. Recall from \nthe Single Study Query Tutorial  that mutations are annotated as \u201cputative drivers\u201d \nor \u201cunknown significance\u201d based on this settings menu in the header: OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nWe can further refine the query by only including those mutations which are \nputative drivers, as defined by the settings menu. We can do this by: \n-Adding _DRIVER to the MUT term in OQL. This will include only mutations that \nare putative drivers (see BRCA1 below) \n-Or, replace the entire OQL string with DRIVER. This will include mutations, \nfusions/structural variant and copy number changes that are putative drivers \n(see BRCA2 below) OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Compare the result of this latest query (top) with the previous query (bottom) and \nsee that the mutations of unknown significance are no longer present. OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page This study is one of the few in cBioPortal that includes germline mutations. We can \nmake one final adjustment to our query to ask a slightly different question: what \npercentage of samples have putative driver germline mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2? \nNote that the OQL for BRCA1 and BRCA2 are equivalent as the GERMLINE term \nonly applies to mutations. OQL Example: \nRTK pathway alterations OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nAlterations in RTK signaling pathway members are common in colorectal \nadenocarcinoma. What is the pattern of alterations across the different levels of the \nsignaling pathway? \nRecall that RTKs (e.g. EGFR, \nERBB2) activate RAS (KRAS, \nNRAS, HRAS) which in turn \nactivate RAF (BRAF, ARAF, \nRAF1) which in turn activate \nMEK (MAP2K1, MAP2K2). \nLet\u2019s query all of these genes: OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page We see here an overview of each individual gene in the pathway. However, it can \nbe informative to instead see each level of the pathway grouped together. OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page We can use gene tracks to group genes together in the OncoPrint. The format is \n[\u201coptional track name\u201d GENE1 GENE2 \u2026 ]: \nOQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page Gene tracks can be combined with other OQL \nterms, either using the DATATYPES command \nas shown here, or attaching OQL to genes \nwithin the square brackets. \nNow we can clearly visualize the pattern of mutual exclusivity of driver alterations at \neach level of the pathway. OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nGene tracks can also be expanded to see tracks for individual genes. To expand, \nclick the    symbol next to the track. \nNote that OncoPrint, Mutual Exclusivity and Group Comparison are the only tabs that currently \nsupport gene tracks. All other tabs show individual genes rather than gene tracks. \nLink to this page Questions? \nCheck out the OQL specification , \nor our other tutorials, \nor email us at: \ncbioportal@googlegroups.com \n\ncBioPortal%20Tutorial%204%20Virtual%20Studies:\ncBioPortal Tutorial #4: \nVirtual Studies \nCreate and save your own custom study comprised \nof samples from existing studies \nLast update: December 23, 2021 Tutorial Objectives \n\u25cfExplain what virtual studies are and how to create them \n\u25cfDelineate the different features available when a user is or is not logged in \n\u25cfShow how to log in Virtual Study Overview \nWhat is a Virtual Study? \nA virtual study is a custom study comprised of samples from one or more existing \nstudies. \nWhy is a virtual study useful? \nThe virtual study feature allows you to define a custom cohort of samples that fit \nyour specific genomic or clinical criteria of interest. These samples can be a \nsubset of the data available in an existing study, or result from the combination of \nmultiple existing studies. This cohort of samples can then be queried or explored \njust like a traditional study, and can be returned to at a later date or shared with a \ncollaborator. In this tutorial, we will create a virtual study \ncomprised of a subset of samples from two existing \nTCGA glioma studies. \nWe begin by selecting the studies of interest and \nviewing them in the Study Summary page. Creating a virtual study: Selecting studies \n1. Use the search \nbox to find the \nstudies of interest \n2. Select the studies \nof interest \n3. Click \u201cExplore \nSelected Studies\u201d \nLink to this page Creating a virtual study: Study summary page \nClick on the       to see \nthe list of studies \nThis is the same Study Summary page that you see for a single study, but now \nwith data from 2 studies. \nLink to this page Creating a virtual study: Study summary page \nUse this table to \nselect samples with \nIDH1 mutations \n(Click the check box in the \u201c#\u201d \ncolumn, then \u201cSelect Samples\u201d at \nthe bottom of the table) In this example, we will additionally filter to samples with mutations in IDH1. \nLink to this page We are now ready to create our virtual study. \nWhat you see will differ slightly depending on if you \nare logged in or not. The next two slides show what \nthe virtual study button looks like in each scenario. \nVirtual study button (not logged in) \nEnter a name for your \nvirtual study (optional) \nClick on the link to open \nyour virtual study, or \nclick \u201cCopy\u201d to copy the \nURL to your clipboard. Text box pre-filled with \na description of the \nstudies contributing \nsamples and filters \napplied to the samples. \nYou can edit this text. \nList of studies \ncontributing to samples \nwith links to the study \nsummary for each Click here to create and \nshare your virtual study \nLink to this page \nVirtual study button (logged in) \nWhen you save a study, it is added to the \nhomepage, at the top of the study list \nunder \u201cMy Virtual Studies\u201d. Clicking \n\u201cQuery\u201d brings you to the query selector \nwith your new virtual study pre-selected. \nThe \u201cSave\u201d button only \nappears when you are \nlogged in. The \u201cShare\u201d button \nworks exactly the same \nas when not logged in \nLink to this page \nWhether or not you are logged in, let\u2019s continue \non to view this new virtual study. Virtual study: Study summary page \nWe can now see the study summary page for our newly created virtual study. You \ncan now explore these samples or run a query, just like with a traditional study. \nRemember that while making this study we filtered down to IDH1 mutant samples, but the non-mutant \nsamples were still present. Now, those samples without mutations are completely gone. \nClick on the       to see the \ndescription of this virtual study \nLink to this page Logging in to cBioPortal: \nIf you use a private instance of cBioPortal, you might \nalready go through an authentication process \n(through your university, for example). If so, there is \nnothing else you need to do. \nBut if you don\u2019t normally log in, then let\u2019s go through \nhow this works. Logging in \nLink to this page \nClick here \nLogging in \nWe use Google and Microsoft for authentication. Sign in with any Google or \nMicrosoft account. Logging in \nLink to this page \nyour email address \nHere\u2019s the virtual \nstudy I made This is what you see \nwhen you log in Virtual Study Authentication Questions \nIs it necessary to log in to use virtual studies? \nNo. A user that has not logged in can create virtual studies and run queries in \nthose studies (by using the query box on the study summary page). Links to virtual \nstudies are permanent, so you can save the link on your computer and come back \nto it anytime, or share it with others. \nIf I do log in, what additional functionality do I gain? \nIf you log in, you gain the ability to save your virtual study to the list of existing \nstudies on the homepage. This makes a virtual study functionally the same as any \nother study: you can access your virtual studies in the query builder and you can \ncombine an existing virtual study with any other study to create a new virtual \nstudy.

            "reasoning": "The summary should include detailed information about the purpose of the Imaging Data Commons (IDC) website, the types of data it provides, the tools available for accessing and analyzing the data, and the specific datasets and anatomical sites covered. This will help users determine if IDC is the appropriate data source for their needs.",
            "summary": "The Imaging Data Commons (IDC) is a cloud-based repository designed to provide access, visualization, and analysis of multi-modal imaging data specifically for cancer research. The primary purpose of IDC is to serve as a comprehensive resource for publicly available cancer imaging data, co-located with various tools and resources for data analysis and exploration. The IDC page offers several navigation options, including sections for About, Explore, Analyze, Submit, Publications, News, and Support, as well as links to related resources such as the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), and the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) standard. Additionally, users can access genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), proteomics data from the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and other specialized datasets from various cancer research initiatives like the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and the Lung Imaging Database Consortium (LIDC). The IDC provides a variety of imaging data types, including clinical and preclinical imaging, radiological images (e.g., CT, MRI, PET), digital pathology images, multispectral microscopy images, image annotations, parametric maps derived from images, measurements derived from images, and expert assessments of image findings. Users can filter data by anatomical sites such as bladder, bone marrow, brain, breast, colon, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, rectum, skin, and uterus. For data access, IDC offers both interactive and programmatic download options. The interactive download is facilitated through the 3D Slicer SlicerIDCBrowser extension, which allows users to explore and download IDC data directly into the 3D Slicer application for visualization and analysis. The programmatic download is supported by the idc-index Python package, which simplifies access to IDC data through a set of API functions for exploring, searching, selecting, and downloading files. The IDC also provides detailed documentation and tutorials to assist users in utilizing these tools effectively. Overall, the IDC is a robust and versatile resource for researchers seeking comprehensive cancer imaging data and associated analytical tools."

CDS \ncurrently hosts a variety of data types from NCI projects and programs such as the \nHuman Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), Division of Cancer Control and Population \nSciences (D CCPS), and Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI), as well as data from \nindependent research projects.  \nCDS provides data -sharing capabilities for additional studies that fall under the following \ncategories:  \n\u2022 Studies with data that do not match any existing CRDC data commons  \n\u2022 Studies with data that do not fit current data type criteria for any CRDC data \ncommons  \nStudies with data that are on a waiting list to become part of  a CRDC Submission  must \nfollow  the steps  described  in \u201cHow to Submit Data \u201d on page 2.  \nSearching the data housed in CDS is easy to do through the Data page, which has a filter \nfunction to find data by categories.  \nAccess to c ontrolled data requires approval from the NIH Data Access Committee  \nthrough the dbGaP  process . 2 Open -access data is publicly accessible  and does not require any approvals. Being a \ncloud repository, CDS does not facilitate direct downloads of data, owing to high data \ndownload charges. However, programs/initiatives can reach out to the CDS Help Desk  to \nrequest downloads if they are willing to fund download s by users approved to access \ntheir data. Please contact the CDS helpdesk for more  information.  \nAccess to data in CDS for review and/or analysis is through the NCI\u2019s Cloud Resource, \nVelsera Cancer Genomics Cloud  (Velsera /CGC)  (formerly Seven Bridges).

Contact the CDS Helpdesk email  with questions or comments . \nc. When CDS receives  the completed New Request Questionnaire , they \nschedule  a data intake interview . It takes one week from the time the \nquestionnaire is received to the time the CDS team schedules an hour -long \ninterview . \n3. Discuss the following at the i nitial interview : \na. Questionnaire responses   \nb. Steps taken to de -identify the data  for PHI/PII  \nc. Requirements for d ata storage  and sharing  \nd. CDS Metadata Template  3 e. Review pre -requisites , including  the dbGaP process , if appropriate . \n4. Approval  \na. CDS notif ies the submitter about approval to submit data . This might take \na week if new data types or new requirements are included.  \n5. Submi tter submits  the following : \na. Complete  and Final metadata manifest  \nb. List of Authorized Data Uploaders  (this includes data uploader name/s, \nemail/s ) \n6. Once CDS receives  the Complete and Final metadata manifest, CDS creates Cloud \nBuckets . \na. CDS sends credentials (for uploader , submission POC, PI). This can take up \nto one week . \n7. The s ubmitter upload s data into the CDS  bucket using the provided credentials . \n8. The s ubmitter notifies CDS when submission is complete . \na. CDS locks the bucket , making it read -only . \n9. CDS begins indexing  studies . \n\u2022 This process takes 6 to 8 weeks . \n\u2022 The process includes indexing and authentication and authorization (the \nprocess of data ingestion for release) . \n\u2022 CDS releases the study  data  for secondary sharing on  the CDS page on \nVelsera /CGC (provide link).  \n\u2022 CDS will try to align the release dates with the dbGaP release schedule as \nmuch as possible . \n\u2022 The dbGaP study page provides a link to CDS . Data can be explored on the \nCDS portal and the CDS page on Velsera /CGC . \n10. Access  the controlled access data on Velsera /CGC, from dbGaP . \na. Go to d bGaP and search for the study of interest . \n\u2022 On the dbGaP study page you are redirected to the CDS Data \nCommons page. \n\u2022 Note that t he data is s earchable via  Velsera/CGC  (formerly known \nas SBG-CGC ). \nb.

            "reasoning": "The summary should include detailed information about the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) and its Cancer Data Service (CDS) repository, as this will help users understand the type of data available, how to access it, and the processes involved in data submission and analysis. This information is crucial for determining if this data source is appropriate for a user's specific data query.",
            "summary": "The Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) is a comprehensive platform designed to provide secure and flexible storage and sharing of data for NCI-funded studies. The Cancer Data Service (CDS) is a key repository within the CRDC, specifically catering to studies that do not match existing CRDC data commons or do not meet current data type criteria and metadata standards. The CDS offers a variety of data types from NCI projects and programs such as the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), and Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI), as well as data from independent research projects. It supports data-sharing capabilities for additional studies that fall under specific categories, including those that do not fit current data type criteria or are on a waiting list to become part of a CRDC submission. The CDS portal provides a user-friendly interface for exploring, accessing, and analyzing data. Users can navigate through various sections such as the Data Types section, Data Submission section, Data Access section, and Data Analysis section. The portal also includes links to specific studies and data, tools and resources for data analysis, and support pages for assistance. Data housed in CDS can be searched using various metadata elements, and access to controlled data requires approval from the NIH Data Access Committee through the dbGaP process. Open-access data is publicly accessible without any approvals. The CDS does not facilitate direct downloads of data due to high data download charges, but programs can request downloads if they are willing to fund them. Data analysis is supported through the NCI\u2019s Cloud Resource, Velsera Cancer Genomics Cloud (formerly Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud), which provides tools and resources for analyzing CDS data. The data submission process involves several steps, including completing a New Request Questionnaire, scheduling a data intake interview, and submitting a metadata manifest. Once approved, data is uploaded to a cloud S3 bucket, indexed, and made available through the CRDC. The indexing process can take 6 to 8 weeks. The CDS also provides a GraphQL interface for querying data, with several example queries available in the CDS User Guide. Overall, the CDS is a robust resource for researchers looking to store, share, and analyze cancer research data, offering a wide range of data types and comprehensive support for data submission and access."

            "reasoning": "The summary should include detailed information about the Ensembl REST API, its purpose, the types of data it provides, and the specific endpoints available. This will help users determine if this data source is appropriate for their genomic data needs.",
            "summary": "The Ensembl REST API webpage serves as a comprehensive resource for accessing a wide range of genomic data through various REST API endpoints. The primary purpose of this page is to provide documentation and facilitate access to Ensembl's genomic data, which includes information on gene trees, homology, cross-references, and species-specific data. Users can navigate to the Ensembl homepage, access a list of available API endpoints, read the user guide, view the change log, learn about the Ensembl project, contact support, and read the privacy notice from this page.\n\nThe webpage is structured into several sections, each dedicated to different types of genomic data. The 'Archive' section includes endpoints for retrieving identifier versions, while the 'Comparative Genomics' section offers endpoints for accessing gene trees and homology information. The 'Cross References' section provides endpoints for looking up external symbols and identifiers. The 'Information' section includes endpoints for retrieving various types of genomic data, such as analyses, assemblies, biotypes, and species information.\n\nSpecific links on the webpage direct users to various resources, including the Ensembl main website, the REST API endpoints, the user guide, the change log, and information about the Ensembl project. Detailed documentation is available for each endpoint, such as retrieving the latest version of a given identifier, accessing gene trees using stable identifiers, retrieving genomic alignments based on region and species, and looking up external symbols to return all linked Ensembl objects.\n\nThe Ensembl REST API also provides example clients in multiple programming languages (Java, Perl, Python, Ruby) to help users get started with querying the API. The API supports various features such as rate limiting, cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), JSON-P, and version migration. The data returned by the service is subject to the same conditions as laid out on the Ensembl website, and users are encouraged to cite relevant publications when using the API in their work.\n\nOverall, the Ensembl REST API webpage is a valuable resource for researchers and developers seeking programmatic access to a wide array of genomic data, with extensive documentation and support to facilitate its use."
