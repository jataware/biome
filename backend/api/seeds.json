Based on the outcomes from the initial five years of \nresearch funding , an additional  program was launched in August of 2011 entitled  \u201cThe Clinical \nProteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium \u201d, or CPTAC .  CPTAC is a comprehensive and \ncoordinated effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the \napplication of robust,  quantitative, proteomic technologies and workflows.  \nThe participating proteome research groups  in CPTAC  recognized the need for a Common \nData Analysis Pipeline  (CDAP)  in order to remove the multiple sources of variability that would \nresult when trying to compare peptides and proteins inferred by each group  using different \nsoftware .  This overview , for non -proteomic researchers,  explains why and how processing \nchoices produce results that appear to differ both qualitatively and quantitatively.   If you alrea dy \nunderstand the elements of peptide and proteomic analyses using mass spectrometry, you might \nskip this document and proceed to use \u201cA Description of the CPTAC Comm on Data Analysis \nPipeline (CDAP) .\u201d  That document details  stepwise the software programs and output files of the  \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline run at NIST . \nProteomics in a Nutshell  \n{ Note to the reader: If you are completely unfamiliar with proteomics, we suggest reading \n\u201cWhat Is Proteomics \u201d.  There are also numerous reviews which are indexed at PubMed.  \n \nIf you are somewhat familiar with proteomics or are coming at this document from a related \nbackground (e.g., genomics), the following is a brief description and analogy as a refresher. } \n \nTissue samples are digested enzymatically to break large proteins into small segments \n(peptides containing 7 -30 am ino acids) that are amenable to automated analysis and assignment Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n4 \n of their amino acid sequences. The digests contain tens of thousands of peptides .  Each \ntryptically digested tumor sample  mixture is separated  using multiple stages of chromatography \nto allo w more effective mass spectrometric analyses of less complex mixtures.  Typically, a \npatient tumor  sample  digest  was chromatographically separated  into 24 fractions, each of which \nwas analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography  (LC)  coupled to a high -resolution \ntandem mass spectrometer  (MS/MS) .  Once introduced into the mass spectrometer, a small mass \nregion ( containing  1 or a few peptides) is fragmented to produce a sequencing mass ladder where \neach peak in the spectrum ( graph displ aying m/z vs. relative intensity data ) corresponds to a sub -\npeptide, fragmented with missing residues from one end or the other.  It is these mass ladders \nthat are analyzed by comparison to theoretical mass ladders produced by in silico  digestion of a \nFAST A database by a search engine.  \nAn analogy to  the chromatographic separation  and mass spectrometric  characterization  \nprocess is offered  to convey the power of the analytical method  and the complexities associated \nwith reporting the results .   \nSuppose you anticipate  a crowd of more than  100,000 people  at a sporting event , \nand want to characterize that group to profile it relative to other crowds .  To learn how \nmany families are present, which children belong to which parents, how many attendees \nare male or female, how many have red/brown/black/grey/no/other color hair, which \nones are related by marriage, which ones share religious beliefs, as well as  other details \nof their personal lives, it would be helpful to pass them through a turnstile and profile \neach of them individually as they enter the stadium.   \nFor protein digests, t he chromatographic step acts like an imperfect turnstile, \noccasionally  separating peptides as individual s, but more frequently allowing small groups Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n5 \n of 5-50 peptides to enter together.  The tandem mass spectrometer analyzer acts like a \nticket taker and  a discriminating usher, dividing peptides first by size (actually, mass -to-\ncharge or \u2018m/z\u2019 ratio) and then by a host of their secondary characteristics (actually, \u2018MS2 \nspectrum\u2019).  The details that emerge from the MS2 spectrum allow each individual peptide \nto be distinguished and characterized as being related or unrelated to others in the \nmixture.    \nWhy a Common Data Analysis Pipeline?    \nA continuation of this analogy is given in support of a common data analysis pipeline.  \n \nSo how can there be different lists summarizing the characteristics of all of the \nindividuals present in the stadium or proteins in a mixture?  Well, suppose  that the stadium \ndata was  analyzed by crackerjack  polling teams and statisticians  from both The Wall Street \nJournal  and The Washington Post .  The same raw data would be coded and entered  for \nidentical individuals , but two very different profiles of the stadium crowd could  emerge .  \nBoth summaries c ould be valid, and not easily reconciled  by reading  the resulting reports .  \nOne statistical  team  might use home address plus cell phone telephone numbers  plus 2012 \nvoter registration lists to designate  their familial groupings ; the other might use zip code \nplus landline  telephone numbers plus 2010 motor vehicle registration  lists from several \nstates for the same purpose.  The analogous software tools that proteomics specialists \nchoose  have many of the same characteristics that make reconcil iation of a stadium \ncrowd\u2019s characteristics difficult when  different  dated, time -dependent, and incomplete \nreference databases  are used.  Why is this true? Some stadium attendees (babies -toddlers) \nwere born after the databases  were compiled ; some people moved  or married after  the lists Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n6 \n were finalized ; some have changed their phone numbers ; some are visiting from Europe to \nattend a family reunion; others are visiting from Australia  and are unrelated to anyone else \nin the stadium.   Analogous problems arise in every proteomics investigation.  It is \nimpossible  for statistical professional polling teams to accurately align individuals and \nfamily relationships  after the fact, whereas it might  have been obvious to a n attentive  and \nvery inquisitive  usher at the ti me of seating.  Correct assignment of peptides to their parent \nproteins is fraught with all of the problems associated with placement of individuals into \ncorrect family relationships.  While some are unambiguous (distinct peptides that can only \nbelong to a  single protein record , coded by a single gene ), others are shared, common to \nmultiple related proteins  coded by several genes .  The resulting quantitative assessment of \na stadium crowd or a protein list becomes dependent upon the evaluator and the \nevaluat or\u2019s measurement tools.  This becomes even more apparent when time has passed \nand the same evaluators profile another stadium crowd or peptide list , but the databases \nfor their analyses have changed , so that the resulting lists have many non -comparable \nentries.  In contrast, it is certainly possible to c ompar e a stadium crowd at a football \nstadium with an equivalent sized crowd at a baseball stadium many months later if the \nsame evaluators apply the same sets of tools to the crowd characterization .  For this \nreason, the NCI determined that a common data analysis pipeline would be beneficial  for \nreporting  results from multi -institutional cancer tumor proteome studies . \n  Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n7 \n  \nIs Original  Instrument Data Retrievable from the Data Coordinating Center ?   \nData resulting from tandem mass spectrometry analyses is recorded in electronic digital \nfiles and stored in formats that are instrument -specific , unaltered over time, and easily  and \naccurately  replicated .  The  Proteome Characterization Centers (PCCs)  at Vanderbilt University, \nBroad Institute, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  (PNNL) , and Johns Hopkins \nUniversity (JHU)  used Thermo  Fisher mass spectrometers , albeit of  several different models, but \nproducing similarly formatted primary data, denoted as \u2018 Filename.raw\u2019  files.  These \nFilename.raw files were transferred from each participating lab to a central Data Coordinating \nCenter  (see Figure 1).  \nAll Filenames were chosen to follow  a standardized 7 -part naming convention, described in a \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n8 \n document entitled  \u201cCPTAC, TCGA Cancer Proteome Study of Breast Tissue Naming \nConventions \u201d available on the Data Coordinating Center website .  Primary Fi lename .raw files \nare available for public download that preserve the original quality of all the recorded \nexperimental data.   However, to facilitate review of this data for those without access to Thermo  \nFisher proprietary software, the Filename.raw files were converte d to \u2018Filename.mzML\u2019 files.  \nThe Filename.mzML formatted files can be viewed with open source ProteoWizard  software \ntools . Alternatively , the original instrument Filename.raw files can be converted to mz ML or \nother ASCII formats using those same tools, following the installation of MSFileReader  from \nThermo Fisher.  \n  Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n9 \n  \nHow Are Lists of Peptides and Their Intensities Generated at NIST?   \n \nThe processing of  the original  Filename.raw instrument files begins with conversion of the \ndata from  \u2018profile mode\u2019 (point -by-point detail that includes m/z peak shapes, resolution, and \nnoise) to \u2018centroid mode\u2019, simple  peak lists of m/z vs. intensities  (Filename.mgf) . \n  \nThe raw data is preserved in text format profile mode  for isotope analysis and \nquantification software  (Filename.mzXML) .  The file conversion process es use  a NIST \nexpan ded version of the ReAdW   converter software from ISB ReAdw4Mascot2 .  The peak list  \nfile (Filename.mgf)  is annotated to include parameters important to peak area quantificat ion in \niTRAQ experiments  used by Broad, PNNL, and JHU .  The iTRAQ experiment requires each \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n10 \n sample to be reacted with a  chemical label, and as a result, allows 3 patient samples to be  mixed \nand analyzed together with a pooled reference standard  employed for all samples .  The iTRAQ \nexperimental results contain sets of quantitative ratios for each set of 3 patients with respect to \nthe common pooled standard.  The iTRAQ process introduces multiple subtle facto rs into data \nanalysis, and consequently , the Filename.mgf record includes notations for peak purity and \nmissing peaks .  [For a concise description of the iTRAQ quantification method used in these \nanalyses, view this  link.] \nThe next steps are to assign peptide sequences to each MS2 spectrum and perform \nquantitative analyses  (Figure 2) .  There are many software tools for peptide sequence \nassignment, but NCI and NIST  selected MS -GF+ after testing several  alternatives.  MS -GF+ \nrequires a database of protein sequences in a standardized text format (FASTA) in which  each \namino acid  is represented by a single letter code.  The database used  in processing the TCGA \nsamples is the National Center for Biote chnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence \n(RefSeq )  for Homo sapiens (build 37) including  the sequence for  S. scrofa (porcine) trypsin \nadded to each sample .  The RefSeq database is a non -redundant collection of protein sequences  \nfrom archival databases.   A second database compiled from TCGA data for individual patient \ngenes is being evaluated for possible re -analysis with MS -GF+.  NIST developed software for \npeak  profile isotope ana lysis and quantification (ProMS) that uses both the Filename.mzXML \nand Filename.mzid input to produce intermediary  and non -public  working files (Filename. txt). \n  Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n11 \n  \nWhat Types of Analyses Were Performed  on Each Tumor  Type ?  Are They \nDirectly Comparable?  \nTryptically -digested sample s can be divided for the purpose of two different types of \nanalysis \u2013 as peptides, and/or as post -translationally modified peptides.  The PNNL and Broad \ngroups chose to separate and characterize both peptides and post-translationally  phosphorylated \n(addition of a phosphate on serine, threonine or tyrosine hydroxyl groups) peptides as potentially \ncharacteristic of ovarian and breast  tumor biology.  JHU chose to  analyze peptides and  separate \nglycosylated  peptides for ovarian cancer samp les; Vanderbilt did not split the colon cancer \nsamples for post -translational peptide analysis , but added a large sample set of normal colon \ntissues .   \nThe interpretation of mass spectra of phosphorylated peptides requires analysis in addition \nto MS -GF+ in order to assign the likely position(s) of phosphate group attachment, and an \nassessment of the probability of that assignment. The software program PhosphoRS [Taus et al., \nJ Pro teome Res.  2011;10(12):5354 -62] provides that information, and was incorporated into the \npipeline (Figure 2).   \nIn contrast, JHU trapped N-glycosylated peptides onto an ion exchange column, and \nenzymatically cleaved the asparagine -linked peptides prior to elution.  Consequently, the \nresulting de -glycosylated peptides can be sequenced using MS -GF+, with the expectation that \nthe former glycosylated asparagine residues will be identified  as aspartic acid.    \nAlthough the same general technology (liquid chromat ography -tandem mass spectrometry) \nwas used by all of the labs, the results should be expected to differ  because of the above \ndifferences in sample processing .   The iTRAQ -labeled peptides will differ  from  those analyzed Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n12 \n by label -free global analysis . The  iTRAQ/phosphoproteomics will differ from those after  de-\nglycosylation /iTRAQ  analysis.  Each specific analytical method would be expected to reveal \nslightly different characteristics of the tumor samples,  with each one having merit, and all likely \nto yield greater information than any one.  One set of samples was analyzed in part by two \nlaboratories using different techniques.  Both PNNL and JHU analyzed 32 ovarian cancer tumors  \nin common using an iTRAQ/gl obal +phospho method (PNNL) and an iTRAQ global + \ndeglycosylation method (JHU).  \n \nHow Was Quality Control Measured?  Were Standard Reference Materials \nUsed?  \nNIST  perform s quality assessment using parameters derived from each of the output files \nfrom quantitation and isotope analysis [Rudnick  et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 2010;  9(2):225 -41].  \nThe files are reviewed  as complete sets  of runs  so that changes in sample handling, i nstrument \nperformance, chromatography, or computer data handling will be detectable .  Examples of \nmeasured metrics  parameters are shown in Figure s 3 and 4 .   NIST quality control programs \ncalculate and track  more than 40 system characteristics , and four of  those that reflect \nchromatography and mass spectrometry instrument performance are  shown  in Figure 3.  The \nnumber of identified tryptic peptide sequence matches (Figure 4) captures and reflects the \nbottom -line performance consistency for any given laborat ory.   Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n13 \n Figure 3. illustrates the consistency of several different performance metrics for 28 separate \nanalyses collected at one of the Proteome Characterization Centers.  MS1  S/N is the signal -to-\nnoise ratio measured for m/z data after the first stage of orbitrap high -resolution mass analysis; \nMS2 S/N is the same metric after the second stage tandem analysis.  Half -period refers to the \ntime over which the middle 50% of the identified peptides elute, and peak width (fwhm) is a \nmeasure of whether the chromat ographic peaks are changing over time.  Both metrics describe \nchromatographic separation quality and consistency.  \nThe result of NIST QC metric monitoring was an observed consistency within each \nlaboratory  for analyses performed of the TCGA samples .  Becaus e each laboratory conducted \ninternal performance checks, and re-ran samples when  necessary, there were no  failed  patient \nsample runs  found in the data pipeline .  This consistent performance level  was possible because \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n14 \n each participating laboratory  pre-tested their experimental protocol  with system suitability \nstudies  using human -in-mouse xenograft breast cancer tumor reference material (CompRef) \ndistributed to all groups for lab-to-lab and within -laboratory performance check s. The same \nCompRef materials were  run between TCGA samples  for quality control , and the resulting \n\u2018interstitial\u2019 CompRef analyses are available for download on the DCC site .    \n \n \nFigure 4 tracks the number of identified peptides across different experiments from one \nPCC.  Each point is a  mean of the number of peptides ( \u00b1SD)  identified from 24 fractions, as \nillustrated  in the inset graph  for Experiment 5 .  Typically, a lower number of peptides elute in \nthe early and late fractions, and a spread of values is expected  due to biological var iations .  \nMonitoring numbers of peptide sequence matches is a measure of overall PCC  performance .  \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n15 \n How Were Proteins and Genes Assigned?  \nEach peptide sequence in the Filename.psm text report is linked to the list of prot eins that \ncontain that sequence  in the reference database , and as a consequence, an all -inclusive list of all \npossible proteins can be derived from those reports.   However, compiling a n all-inclusive list of \nall possible proteins is not very useful to biologists because it violates the princ iple of parsimony  \n(Occam\u2019s razor) .  Applying this principle, the shortest list of candidate  protein s or genes  that can \nexplain all of the data is more likely to be correct.  Software for performing  parsimonious  protein \nassignments  requires that peptide sequences an d candidate proteins be considered and sorted \ntogether  in order to solve for  the smallest set solution  (Figure 5) .  \nCompounding this task, there are many shared peptides among protein isoforms .  Consequently, \nit is not possible to determine quantitatively how much of each peptide originated from a specific \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n16 \n protein isoform.  Because biologists view proteins as gene products, we elected to bypass the \nprotein isoform conundrum and assign peptides di rectly to a parsimonious set of genes  (Figure \n5), a task performed  at DCC by Dr. Nathan Edwards  using software designed for this purpose .  \nWhile gene assignment  does not eliminate  quantitative  assignment  ambiguity for all cases, \nthe inferred parsimonious set of genes generates a simpler path to the desired output needed by \nbiologists and medi cal professionals, particularly those assessing biological networks and \nsystems.  For biologists interested in biomarker candidates, the only meaningful experimentally  \nmeasured quantitative data resides in the peptide sequence match (Filename.psm) reports.  Any \ninferred summation of quantitative peptide data necessitates compromises . \nWhat Type of Gene Summary Reports are Available?  \nThe gene summaries are experiment specific, so that there are separate sets for PNNL -\novarian, JHU - ovarian, Broad breast, and Va nderbilt colo -rectal cancers.  Each experiment has \ntext summaries, gene-inference ; peptide -gene relationships; gene -inference based quantification \nbased on iTRAQ ratios using m/z117 as a pool reference value; and for label -free (Vanderbilt)  \ngene -inference based spectral count and precursor area quantitation.  \n \nWhy Are Mass Spectral Library Spectra Produced?  \nHow Can They Be Accessed?  \n Mass spectral files accumulated  by the CPTAC project contain >100 million mass \nspectra.  The mass spectrum of each unique peptide sequence exhibits a characteristic \nreproducible pattern of mass/charge vs. intensity, much like an individual\u2019s fingerprint .  \nConsequently, mass spectral libraries of previously characterized components permit very rapid Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n17 \n identification of the  same peptide s when encountered in future studies , a process not unlike \nfinding facts in a library of bound volumes, as illustrated in Figure 7. \n \n \nThe NIST Mass Spectrometry Data Center established repositories  of compound speci fic mass \nspectral data useful for rapid recognition of simple chemical structures like drugs, pesticides, \nsteroids, amino acids, etc., beginning in the 1970s .  These libraries and associated software \nenabling spectral matching have been widely accepted in analytical laboratories worldwide.  \nMore recently,  libraries of tandem mass spectra of peptides recorded using liquid \nchromatographic separ ation, electrospray ionization  using  ion trap -type  instrumentation have \nbeen distributed to the public by NIST after  several steps of curation .  Composite consensus \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n18 \n spectra are derived from comparing many spectra of the same peptide determined at different \nintensi ties, as illustrated in Figure 7.   \n \nCompilations are assembled from spectra acquired using similar mass spectral instrumentation .  \nFor example, the Vanderbilt data yielded a library of > 98 thousand consensus spectra.  These \nwere merged in the latest public release of the NIST Human tandem peptide library that now \ncontain s >340 thousand  consensus  tandem  spectra  recorded using ion trap instrumentation .  Data \nfrom the Broad, JHU, and PNNL studies was collected using a cycloidal ion trap with image \ncurrent detection  (Orbitrap \u2122),  and resulted in a library of  >1 million  consensus  iTRAQ spectra \ndistilled from   > 56 million total collected spectra .   Similarly, s eparat e libraries were compiled \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n19 \n from global and iTRAQ -Phospho Orbitrap \u2122 data sets.   All of these libraries are being distributed \nthrough the NIST public websites or through links accessible on the CPTAC -DCC w ebsite.  \n \nOverview of  Processed Data  \n \nWhat Makes Files from each Institution U nique?  \n The CPTAC studies  of TCGA samples  were planned to utilize state -of-the-art \ninstrumentation i n each institution with the expectation that results are parallel, but not pre cisely \nmirrored.  \n \nTable 1 summarizes some of the key factors that are similar, but differ not only with respect to \ntumor type, but also the sample workup protocol, analytical instrumentation, and  separation.  \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n20 \n How differences in protocols are likely to affect results can be anticipated from general \nunderstanding of the experimental options .  Most importantly, the protocol differences should \nnot alter the underlying biological conclusions reached .  The iTRAQ prot ocol should produce \ntighter quantitative analytical data for comparisons between samples.  Think of competitive track \nracing for an analogy for 4 -plex iTRAQ experiment.  If 4 runners compete in a track race \ntogether and the winner  of the first race compete s with another set of 3 runners,  the result will \nallow precise comparison  of the entire set of seven in the time required to run two races, similar \nto an iTRAQ experiment where 3 samples are mixed with a 4th as a consistent standard.  In \ncontrast, if seve n athletes compete by running individual heats, the seven events will require \nlonger, in analogy to the non -iTRAQ method used by Vanderbilt.   The trade -off is that observers \nof both events view runners either in a group or as individuals.  The iTRAQ exper iment \nsomewhat dilutes the signal for each component, but the non -iTRAQ alternative increase \ncomparative quantitative variability and requires longer instrument time.  Other differences in \nthe protocols (numbers of fractions, type of columns  or fragmentati on) are technical, like \ndifferences in track surface or weather, and not likely to produce substantive differences in data \nsets. \nWhat Makes All Data Sets C omparable?  \n The use of a Common Data Analysis Pipeline results in files that can be directly queried \nand compared with respect to peptides and genes that may be indicative of activated or \nsuppressed pathways in different cancer tumor types.   The parameters listed in Table 2 define   \nsome of the many options that were applied consistently to the processed data sets.  Within \nproteomics, there are many  data analysis software tools, and, in addition to the CDAP, multiple \nanalyses of CPTAC data appear in the scientific literature .  It is likely that summary  data Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n21 \n published by each institution differ s qualitative ly and quantitatively somewhat from that \nprocessed by CDAP  because each lab reports using specifically dated reference databases and \nsoftware tools . \n \nTable 2   \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n22 \n  \nHow and Why Institute Published Data May Differ from CDAP Results  \n First, the bioinformaticians at each Proteome Characterization Center select the search  \nengines, reference databases, and parameters that they believe will produce the most useful and \ncomprehensive data analysis for their output.  While a committee of Proteome Characterization \nCenter members agreed on the publicly accessible and well documented tools and methods for \nthe common pipeline, the same scientists  were free to select software and modify/ extend \ndatabases where they thought there were significant adv antages for processing their own data.   \nFor example, the team at PNNL first \u2018refined\u2019 their mass spectral data, having recognized that \ncertain  instrumental drift could be eliminated while improving the accuracy of m/z assignments.  \nSubsequent peptide searc hing using the same MS -GF+ software enhanced the numbers of \npeptide sequence matches from data relative to CDAP results.  In contrast, the JHU team \nselected  conservative  parameters for processing that yielded slightly fewer peptide sequence \nmatches using t he same MS -GF+ software.  The Broad team prefers a different search engine \n(SpectrumMill, proprietary software  from Agilent ).  Their results substantially agree with those \nfrom the CDAP, but the CDAP\u2019s allowance of semi -tryptic peptides resulted in some pe ptide \nsequence matches that the Broad team prefer s not to include for iTRAQ quantification.  \nVanderbilt\u2019s bioinformatics team elected to use multiple search tools (library search  with \n\u2018Pepitome \u2019 and a  second search engine \u2018MyriMatch \u2019) to improve their abil ity to assign spectra \nrelative to the single MS -GF+ search  used by CDAP .  The multiple search engine and library \nstrategies are well documented to enhance  peptide sequence matching for the  global label -free \nproteomics using Collisional Induced Dissociation  (CID) fragmentation in the LC/MS/MS \nexperiment performed at  Vanderbilt.  Library search strategies are not applicable to   the Higher -Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n23 \n energy C -trap Dissociation  fragmentation ( HCD ) data produced at the other centers, but all of the \nother TCGA data could yield a greater number of  peptide sequence matches with the use of \nadditional search engines that employ strategies orthogonal to that of MS -GF+.   \nTCGA Proteome Data Sets are a Rich Resource for Bioinformatics  Investigations  \nThe composite data sets for e ach TCGA sample experiment are larger and more \ncomprehensive than any previous  proteomic investigations of cancer tumors.  Consequently, they \nare useful for future bioinformatics analyses on many levels. Additional processing is planned \nboth at NIST/DCC an d at each Proteome Characterization Center .  For example, patient -specific \ngenome data will be used to search all data sets for tumor specific peptides.  At the same time, \nemploying second or third search engines may enhance peptide sequence detection.  Th ere are \nlarge numbers of unidentified MS2 spectra from abundant components (30% or more of the total \nacquired spectra) that are consistently observed in samples, and these require invest igation and \ncharacterization.  NIST libraries of frequently encountered, unidentified mass spectra  will aide \nfuture research  by rapidly recognition  of novel components vs. commonly encountered artifacts.  \nAs with any data analysis, the CPTAC data require careful consideration of the \nassumptions and uncertainties inherent within the analysis methods and measurements.  The \nNIST team is responsible for ensuring that biological and clinical conclusions drawn from CDAP \ndata are based on a consistently high level of proteomics data quality.  \n ",

The command line (CL) version is recommended for those that have some experience with command line tools in cases where the user needs to download a large volume data in an organized manner. For users that prefer a graphical interface, the PDC Data Download Client User Interface (UI) is available.\n\nSystem requirements\n\nOS: Linux (Ubuntu 14.x or later, CentOS 7), OS X (10.9 Mavericks or\u202f< 12.0\u202f), or Windows (7 or later)\n\nPlease delete any previous instances of the download client before downloading a newer version.\n\nDownloading the PDC Data Download Client\n\nBinary Distributions: The following zip folders contain both the Command Line & UI versions for each OS.\n\nPlatform PDC Data Download Client Command Line & User Interface Linux pdc-client_v1.0.8_Ubuntu_x64.zip OS X pdc-client_v1.0.8_OSX_x64.zip Windows pdc-client_v1.0.8_Windows_x64.zip\n\nRelease Notes\n\nPlease click here for the release notes of the Download Client.\n\nKnown Issues\n\nThere is a limit of 10 download attempts per individual file. This limit includes the retries that are automatically attempted by the download client. The current error message does not reflect this (CL).\n\nOn this page:\n\nObtaining a File manifest for Data download\n\nData Download Client User Interface (UI)\n\nData Download Client Command Line\n\nObtaining a File manifest for Data download\n\nIn order to download files using either the UI or command line version of the PDC data download client, you will need to have a file manifest downloaded from the PDC portal. To generate a file manifest, go to the \u2018Explore\u2019 page, and apply filters to isolate the study or group of studies you want to download files from. Navigate to the files tab and select the files you wish to download. You can use the dropdown in the upper left corner to select all files available for the studies you have filtered by choosing the \u2018select all pages\u2019 option. With the desired files selected, choose either the CSV or TSV option of the \u2018Export File Manifest\u2019 feature. Both formats are supported by the PDC data download client. Place the downloaded manifest in the same directory as the download client executable, or in another known location.\n\nIn order to download files using either the UI or command line version of the PDC data download client, you will need to have a file manifest downloaded from the PDC portal.

Place the downloaded manifest in the same directory as the download client executable, or in another known location.\n\nNote: The PDC data download client will reject manifests older than one week (168 hours), as the download URLs will no longer be valid.\n\nData Download Client User Interface (UI)\n\nInstallation Prerequisites\n\nFirst, begin by clicking on the link in the \u201cPDC Data Download Client Command Line & User Interface\u201d column of the \u201cBinary Distributions\u201d table above that corresponds to your operating system type. The zip folder contains both the CL & UI versions. To use the UI version, unzip the folder that contains 'UI' in the file name and follow the installation instructions below. Note the system requirements displayed above the table. If your particular operating system does not meet the version requirements, the download client UI may not run. To view operating system version on Windows, go to the start menu, search for and select \u2018System Information\u2019. To view the operating system version on Mac, navigate to the apple menu and select \u2018About This Mac\u2019. Methods for viewing the Linux version will depend on the distribution but opening the command prompt and using the \u2018lsb-release\u2019 command will display version information on common Debian-based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu.   Clicking on a link will begin the download of the Zip (.zip extension) file containing the download client. Depending on your operating system version, it may be necessary to install an archive manager to extract the archive\u2019s files. Most current operating system versions will have tools for managing Zip files built in.\n\nOS X Installation Instructions\n\nOn OS X, the Zip file will contain a DMG file which can be run to install the PDC Data download client UI. Navigate to the downloaded Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default. Extracting the file (double clicking on the Zip file or right-click -> \u201copen with\u201d -> \u201cZip file utility\u201d) will produce the DMG file. Double click the DMG file to install the PDC download client. You will be prompted to move the client to your \u2018Applications\u2019 folder during the installation process. If you run into an error such as 'macOS cannot verify the developer of \u201cpdcdownloadclient\u201d. Are you sure you want to open it?', please navigate to 'Security preferences' -> 'Security and Privacy' settings of your MAC machine and choose an option to run the app. Now you can run the PDC download client UI as you would any other application.\n\nWindows installation Instructions\n\nOn Windows, the Zip file will contain all the necessary components to run the UI client. Navigate to the Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default. Note that if you double click on the file, it will open the Zip file; however, you must extract all files to run the client. You may extract the files to any folder you would like. To do this right-click the Zip file and choose \u201cExtract All\u201d, or open the Zip file, select all the files, and move them to the destination folder by dragging them or copying and pasting them. Open the extracted folder and look for the \u2018pdcDownloadClient.exe\u2019 executable file; double clicking this file will open the PDC Data Download Client UI. If you run into an error such as 'Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk', please click on 'More info' and choose 'Run anyway'. You may create a shortcut to the executable file for easy access in the future.\n\nUbuntu Installation Instructions\n\nOn Linux, the Zip file will contain an AppImage file which can be run to install the PDC Data download client UI. Navigate to the downloaded Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default. Extracting the file (double clicking on the Zip file or right-click -> \u201copen with\u201d -> \u201cZip file utility\u201d) will produce the executable file. Double click the AppImage file to install the PDC download client. In some cases where you\u2019re unable to run the app, you might have to install the \u201clibfuse2\u201d package which is an interface used by the Linux kernel for userspace programs to export a filesystem to the kernel. For installing it, please open the command prompt and run \u201csudo apt-get install -y libfuse2\u201d. Now you can run the PDC download client UI as you would any other application.\n\nOn Linux, the Zip file will contain an AppImage file which can be run to install the PDC Data download client UI. Navigate to the downloaded Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default.

For installing it, please open the command prompt and run \u201csudo apt-get install -y libfuse2\u201d. Now you can run the PDC download client UI as you would any other application.\n\nSome Ubuntu users might run into the error \u201dNo application installed for AppImage application bundle files\u201d while trying to run the client. In order to resolve this error, right-click on the extracted AppImage file -> Properties -> Permissions -> select \u201dAllow Executing File as a Program\u201d. Then try running it again by double-clicking or right-click -> Open. This will resolve the issue and you'll be able to run the application.\n\nBasic Usage\n\nExecuting the PDC data download client UI by running the standalone executable will open the UI. Here, you may start the download process by selecting a file manifest. Clicking the \u2018Select Manifest File\u2019 button will allow you to browse for the manifest.\n\nExecuting the PDC data download client UI by running the standalone executable will open the UI. Here, you may start the download process by selecting a file manifest. Clicking the \u2018Select Manifest File\u2019 button will allow you to browse for the manifest.\n\nTo select the files you wish to download, click the checkbox in the leftmost column of the table next to the desired file. Clicking the checkbox in the top left of the table will select all files present in the manifest. Once you have selected the files you wish to download, click the \u2018Download\u2019 button on the bottom right to begin downloading your files. Files that have been downloaded successfully will appear in the \u2018Completed\u2019 tab. In the event you either cancel the download by clicking the \u2018Stop\u2019 button or if the download fails, the files left to download will appear in the \u2018Failed\u2019 or \u2018Stopped\u2019 tab. By navigating to those tabs, you may select the remaining files and resume the download. 'Skipped' tab lists previously downloaded files that already exist in the download path.\n\nNote: When exiting the client, any failed or stopped downloads will remain visible the next time the PDC Download Client UI is run. Uploading a new manifest, or hitting the \u2018Clear Cache\u2019 button will reset these tabs.\n\nConfiguring the download client\n\nClicking on the \u2018Settings\u2019 tab will allow you to configure various options for downloading your data.\n\nThe \u2018Destination Folder\u2019 field along with the 'Browse' button allows you to enter the file path to which your files will be downloaded. If the file path or folder that is entered cannot be found a warning will appear when hitting \u2018Save Settings\u2019 indicating that the file path is not valid.\n\nThe \u2018Use PDC default directory structure\u2019 option specifies whether to use the default directory structure:\n\nThe \u2018Use PDC default directory structure\u2019 option specifies whether to use the default directory structure:\n\nPDC Study ID -> Study Version Number -> Data Category -> Run Metadata ID (if applicable) -> File Format or an alternative structure, where each file is given its own folder in the parent directory.\n\nThe \u2018Calculate Inbound Segment and check Md5sum on Restart\u2019 and \u2018Check Md5sum after Download\u2019 options are optional features that ensures file integrity is maintained.\n\nOther parameters you may configure are present in the \u2018Advanced Settings\u2019. These settings share their behavior with the optional arguments for the PDC Data Download Command Line tool.\n\nData Download Client Command Line\n\nBasic Usage\n\nOnce the file manifest has been exported you are ready to download files using the command line tool. Executing the PDC data download client without any parameters will show the available base commands and Note: Trying to use the executable directly by double-clicking will only cause a window to appear briefly. The PDC Data Download Client can only be run using the command-line. Select 'Command Prompt' on Microsoft Windows or 'Terminal' in OS X or Ubuntu to open a new command-line instance.\n\nOnce the file manifest has been exported you are ready to download files using the command line tool.

Select 'Command Prompt' on Microsoft Windows or 'Terminal' in OS X or Ubuntu to open a new command-line instance.\n\nNote: For a Windows machine, please install a tool equivalent of Git Bash to run Unix commands.\n\nThe path to the file manifest is included in the download command with the inclusion of the\n\nm or\n\n--manifest followed by the location and name of the manifest\n\nNavigate to the directory where the binary and manifest files are present. (Eg Downloads directory: /home/Users/Downloads)\n\ncd /home/Users/Downloads\n\nRun the following command\n\n./pdc-client.exe download -m PDC_file_manifest_05032022_145231.tsv\n\nDirectory Structure of Downloaded Files\n\nThe default behavior of the PDC data download client is to download files into a directory tree with the following format to the directory in which the client was run:\n\nThe default behavior of the PDC data download client is to download files into a directory tree with the following format to the directory in which the client was run:\n\nPDC Study ID -> Study Version Number -> Data Category -> Run Metadata ID (if applicable) -> File Format\n\nUsers may also choose an alternative format that downloads each file into its own separate directory by providing the\n\n--not-retain-pdc-download-path option.\n\n./pdc-client.exe download -m PDC_file_manifest_05032022_145231.tsv --not-retain-pdc-download-path\n\nWhen using this option it is possible to specify an alternative directory in which to download the files. Provide the\n\n--dir followed by the desired file path. This will place all downloaded files in the specified location without creating individual folders for each file. The\n\n--dir option is only available when used in combination with the\n\n--not-retain-pdc-download-path option. If\n\n--not-retain-pdc-download-path is not specified, the\n\n--dir option is ignored, and files will be downloaded in the current directory in the standard PDC download path.\n\n./pdc-client.exe download -m PDC_file_manifest_05032022_145231.tsv --not-retain-pdc-download-path --dir /Example/Directory/Path\n\nNote: The specified directory must be created prior to running the command; the client will not create the directory itself and an error will be thrown if the directory cannot be found.\n\nResuming a Failed Download\n\nIn the event a file fails to download, a file with the '.partial' extension will appear in the destination folder. To complete the download of these files, repeat the download command with the same destination path and a manifest containing the failed/missing files; the PDC Data Download Client will identify and download any missing and partial files. Files present in the manifest that were successfully downloaded will be automatically skipped.\n\nIn the event a file fails to download, a file with the '.partial' extension will appear in the destination folder.

Files present in the manifest that were successfully downloaded will be automatically skipped.\n\nNote: The PDC allows for a maximum of 10 retries for a given file within a 24-hour period. The number of retries to be automatically attempted can be specified with the\n\n--retry-amount option, or the automatic retries can be disabled with the\n\n--no-auto-retry option. The client will notify you when the limit has been reached for a particular file.\n\nFile Integrity Checks\n\nEvery file distributed by the PDC has had its MD5 sum calculated; this value can be found in the file manifests. By default, the PDC Data Download client will calculate the MD5 of any downloaded files and verify it against the value in the manifest. This ensures the downloaded files and the version stored by the PDC are identical, and no file corruption has occurred.

Place the downloaded manifest in the same directory as the download client executable, or in another known location.\n\nNote: The PDC data download client will reject manifests older than one week (168 hours), as the download URLs will no longer be valid.\n\nData Download Client User Interface (UI)\n\nInstallation Prerequisites\n\nFirst, begin by clicking on the link in the \u201cPDC Data Download Client Command Line & User Interface\u201d column of the \u201cBinary Distributions\u201d table above that corresponds to your operating system type. The zip folder contains both the CL & UI versions. To use the UI version, unzip the folder that contains 'UI' in the file name and follow the installation instructions below. Note the system requirements displayed above the table. If your particular operating system does not meet the version requirements, the download client UI may not run. To view operating system version on Windows, go to the start menu, search for and select \u2018System Information\u2019. To view the operating system version on Mac, navigate to the apple menu and select \u2018About This Mac\u2019. Methods for viewing the Linux version will depend on the distribution but opening the command prompt and using the \u2018lsb-release\u2019 command will display version information on common Debian-based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu.   Clicking on a link will begin the download of the Zip (.zip extension) file containing the download client. Depending on your operating system version, it may be necessary to install an archive manager to extract the archive\u2019s files. Most current operating system versions will have tools for managing Zip files built in.\n\nOS X Installation Instructions\n\nOn OS X, the Zip file will contain a DMG file which can be run to install the PDC Data download client UI. Navigate to the downloaded Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default. Extracting the file (double clicking on the Zip file or right-click -> \u201copen with\u201d -> \u201cZip file utility\u201d) will produce the DMG file. Double click the DMG file to install the PDC download client. You will be prompted to move the client to your \u2018Applications\u2019 folder during the installation process. If you run into an error such as 'macOS cannot verify the developer of \u201cpdcdownloadclient\u201d. Are you sure you want to open it?', please navigate to 'Security preferences' -> 'Security and Privacy' settings of your MAC machine and choose an option to run the app. Now you can run the PDC download client UI as you would any other application.\n\nWindows installation Instructions\n\nOn Windows, the Zip file will contain all the necessary components to run the UI client. Navigate to the Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default. Note that if you double click on the file, it will open the Zip file; however, you must extract all files to run the client. You may extract the files to any folder you would like. To do this right-click the Zip file and choose \u201cExtract All\u201d, or open the Zip file, select all the files, and move them to the destination folder by dragging them or copying and pasting them. Open the extracted folder and look for the \u2018pdcDownloadClient.exe\u2019 executable file; double clicking this file will open the PDC Data Download Client UI. If you run into an error such as 'Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk', please click on 'More info' and choose 'Run anyway'. You may create a shortcut to the executable file for easy access in the future.\n\nUbuntu Installation Instructions\n\nOn Linux, the Zip file will contain an AppImage file which can be run to install the PDC Data download client UI. Navigate to the downloaded Zip file, which should appear in your downloads folder by default. Extracting the file (double clicking on the Zip file or right-click -> \u201copen with\u201d -> \u201cZip file utility\u201d) will produce the executable file. Double click the AppImage file to install the PDC download client. In some cases where you\u2019re unable to run the app, you might have to install the \u201clibfuse2\u201d package which is an interface used by the Linux kernel for userspace programs to export a filesystem to the kernel. For installing it, please open the command prompt and run \u201csudo apt-get install -y libfuse2\u201d. Now you can run the PDC download client UI as you would any other application.\n\nOn Linux, the Zip file will contain an AppImage file which can be run to install the PDC Data download client UI.

This will help users determine if this platform is the right data source for their specific needs, such as identifying drug targets, exploring disease associations, or accessing drug information.",
            "summary": "The Open Targets Platform (OT) is a comprehensive tool designed to support the systematic identification and prioritization of potential therapeutic drug targets. It integrates publicly available datasets to build and score target-disease associations, assisting researchers and pharmaceutical companies in drug target identification and prioritization. The platform is freely available and updated bi-monthly, ensuring users have access to the latest data and insights in the field of drug discovery and development.\n\nThe platform provides a wide range of data, including detailed annotations about targets, diseases, phenotypes, and drugs. Users can search for specific targets, diseases, and drugs, and view associations between them. For example, users can explore data related to specific genes like PTEN and PTGS2, diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and drugs like LYRICA and HUMIRA. This makes the platform a valuable resource for understanding the relationships between different biological entities and their implications for therapeutic development.\n\nIn addition to its search functionalities, the Open Targets Platform offers several other features. Users can access platform documentation to get started, download datasets for more extensive analyses, and utilize the GraphQL API for graphical queries across the platform's knowledge graph. The API is optimized for single queries, but users can also perform more programmatic or systematic analyses using dataset downloads or the Google BigQuery instance. The platform also provides access to release notes, platform publications, and a community forum where users can discuss and share information.\n\nThe platform's interface includes a header with navigation links to documentation, data downloads, the API, and the community forum. There is also a search bar for quick access to specific targets, diseases, and drugs, and a footer with additional links to the community forum, privacy notice, terms of use, and information about the platform's partners and social media channels. The platform is supported by several partner organizations, including EMBL-EBI, Genentech, GSK, MSD, Pfizer, Sanofi, and the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\n\nOverall, the Open Targets Platform is a robust and versatile resource for researchers and professionals in the field of drug discovery, providing essential data and tools for identifying and prioritizing therapeutic targets."

spring/summer, and we highly recommend delaying any serious development against it until we release the new version. However, if you are interested in working with our API, we would love to hear from you, especially as we work out what capabilities we will offer. We would be happy to work with you during our development, and to bring your group on as beta testers when we get closer to release.\n\nquerygetReturns all column names and definitions for schemapostExecute Subject querypostExecute Subject Files querypostExecute Subjects Counts querypostExecute Subjects File Counts querypostExecute Research Subject querypostExecute ResearchSubject Files querypostExecute ResearchSubjects Counts querypostExecute ResearchSubjects File Counts querypostExecute Specimens querypostExecute Specimen Files querypostExecute Specimen Counts querypostExecute Specimen File Counts querypostExecute Diagnosis querypostExecute Diagnosis Counts querypostExecute Mutation querypostExecute Mutation Counts querypostExecute Treatments querypostExecute Treatments Counts querypostReturns all unique valuespostReturns counts of the DCSpostReturns a list of files given a boolean querypostExecute File Counts querymetagetCDA statusgetDescription of latest datasetgetList descriptions of all available datasetsAPI docs by RedoclyCDA API (3.2.0)Download OpenAPI specification:Download  License: Apache 2.0 API definition for the CDA\nqueryRetrieve the data stored in the CDA.\nReturns all column names and definitions for schema Return columnNames for schema along with their descriptions\nResponses200 columns response\nget/api/v1/columnshttps://cancerdata.dsde-prod.broadinstitute.org/api/v1/columns Response samples 200Content typeapplication/jsonCopy Expand all  Collapse all {\"result\": [{ }]}Execute Subject query Execute a Subject query composed of conditions on columns combined with boolean operators.

This will help in determining if this data source is suitable for specific user queries related to canine cancer research data.",
            "summary": "The Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC) is a specialized platform designed to provide access to and facilitate the exploration of canine cancer research data. The primary purpose of the ICDC is to support researchers by offering a comprehensive repository of data related to various studies, cases, and samples of canine cancer. Users can filter, view, and download data, making it a valuable resource for those involved in veterinary oncology and comparative oncology research. The ICDC is part of the larger NCI Cancer Research Data Commons, which provides a broader range of cancer research data across species.\n\nThe ICDC website is structured with several key sections to aid in data navigation and exploration. The main navigation bar includes links to Home, Explore, Programs, Studies, Data, Resources, and About sections. Each section provides specific functionalities and information. For instance, the 'Explore' section allows users to delve into the data, while the 'Programs' and 'Studies' sections offer detailed information on various research programs and individual studies, respectively.\n\nUsers can manage their data files in the 'My Files' section, where they can view and organize files related to their research. The 'Filter By Cases' section provides extensive filtering options, allowing users to narrow down data by criteria such as Program, Study, Study Type, Biobank, Study Participation, Breed, Diagnosis, Primary Disease Site, Stage of Disease, Response to Treatment, Sex, and Neutered Status. This level of granularity ensures that researchers can find the specific data they need for their studies.\n\nThe website also features a data visualization section that displays information on Programs and Studies, Breed, Diagnosis, Stage of Disease, Sex, and File Type. This visual representation helps users quickly grasp the distribution and characteristics of the data. Additionally, there are tabs for Cases, Samples, Case Files, and Study Files, each providing detailed listings and options for data management.\n\nAction buttons on the website allow users to add files, view data in JBrowse (a genome browser), and download table contents as CSV files. Pagination controls are available to navigate through large datasets. The ICDC also supports GraphQL queries, enabling advanced users to write, validate, and test queries directly within the browser.\n\nOverall, the ICDC is a robust and user-friendly platform designed to support the needs of researchers in the field of canine cancer. It offers a wide range of data and tools to facilitate in-depth research and data analysis, making it an essential resource for anyone involved in this area of study."

Explorer enables analysis and interrogation of individual single cell data sets. This section describes Explorer's capabilities.\n\nJust getting started with the tool? We recommend going through these tutorials in order to learn how to use the tool.\n\nReturning for a quick refresh? We\u2019ve identified the key concepts below the tutorial so you can skim through and find what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nYou can follow along with any of these tutorials by launching an instance of the CELLxGENE Explorer with the Tabula Sapiens using this CELLxGENE Explorer link. For more information on Tabula Sapiens, you can refer to the preprint on biorxiv.\n\nCZ CELLxGENE Explorer Interface\n\nCELLxGENE Explorer's user interface organizes single cell data similarly to how it is organized in single cell data formats. The left hand side displays categorical and numerical sample metadata. The right hand side is a space for displaying features such as genes and gene sets. The center displays the embedding, where each cell is a point. UMAP and tSNE are common embeddings, which place cells based on their local distances in gene expression space. Cells from spatial data can also be displayed using each cell's (x, y) coordinates.\n\nKey Concepts: User Interface Explanation\n\nExamining Categorical Metadata\n\nCategorical metadata (such as tissue of origin or cell type) can be used in a number of ways within Explorer including coloring embedding plots (i.e. color UMAP by cell type), looking at cell counts, within a categorical metadata field, making selections of cells or viewing the interaction between different categorical metadata fields.\n\nKey Concepts: Categorical Metadata, Selecting Cells by Category (i.e. cell type), Interaction Between Categorical Metadata Fields\n\nFind Cells Where a Gene is Expressed\n\nNumerical metadata (such gene expression features or QC metrics such as number of genes) can be examined on the embedding plot and be used to filter and select cells. Additionally tools like the clip tool can give us control over how these attributes are displayed on the embedding plot.\n\nKey Concepts: Numerical Metadata, Cell Filtering and Selection, Interaction Between Numerical Metadata, Categorical Metadata Fields\n\nSelecting and Subsetting Cells\n\nExplorer allows for the complex selection of cells via selection directly on the embedding, gene expression cutoffs, and based on categorical metadata attributes.\n\nKey Concepts: Categorical Metadata Selection, Numerical Metadata Selection, Complex Selection (combining selection methods)\n\nCompare Expression of Multiple Genes\n\nExplorer allows you to compare the expression of multiple genes via bivariate plots.\n\nKey Concepts: Gene Expression, Co-expression, Cell Selection, Subsetting\n\nUsing Gene Sets to Learn About Cell Population Functional Characteristics\n\nExplorer allows you to examine groups of genes via the gene sets feature.\n\nKey Concepts: Gene Expression, Co-expression, Cell Selection, Subsetting\n\nListed below is a comma separated gene set list for use with this tutorial.\n\nACAA1, ACAA2, ACADL, ACADM, ACADS, ACADSB, ACADVL, ACAT1, ACAT2, ACOX1, ACOX3, ACSL1, ACSL3, ACSL4, ACSL5, ACSL6, ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C, ADH4, ADH5, ADH6, ADH7, ALDH1B1, ALDH2, ALDH3A2, ALDH7A1, ALDH9A1, CPT1A, CPT1B, CPT1C, CPT2, CYP4A11, CYP4A22, ECHS1, ECI1, ECI2, EHHADH, GCDH, HADH, HADHA, HADHB\n\nFind Marker Genes\n\nExplorer allows you to find marker genes between selected cell populations.\n\nKey Concepts: Gene Expression, Differential Expression, Cell Selection, Subsetting\n\nNote: You can find more information here about how our differential expression is calculated. In brief, we use a Welch's t-test. While we are aware that single cell data does not always meet the assumptions imposed by this test, we utilize it because it performs well at identifying the most differentially expressed genes, and this is what our feature returns.",

Q: Is there an association between alterations \nin a particular query gene and age? \nA: We can see that patients with mutations or \namplifications in EGFR tend to be older than \nthose with mutations in IDH1/IDH2 \nLink to this page Now we\u2019re going to go through all the other tabs and \nask some questions about alterations in IDH1 , IDH2  \nand EGFR  in the TCGA Lower-Grade Glioma study. \nNote: Depending on the data available for a \nparticular study, not all of the following tabs will be \npresent (e.g. a study without expression data will not \nhave a Co-expression tab) Cancer Types Summary \nHover over a bar to see \nadditional details. Histogram of the frequency of alterations in \neach gene for each detailed cancer type. \nQ: Are alterations in EGFR more frequent in a \nparticular subtype of glioma? \nA: Yes, astrocytoma appears to have a much \nhigher frequency of EGFR alteration than \noligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma. \nLink to this page Options to \ncustomize \nvisualization Plots for all \nqueried genes \ntogether and \neach individual \ngene are \navailable as \nseparate tabs. \nMutual Exclusivity \nAll pairwise \ncombinations of query \ngenes analyzed for \nmutual exclusivity or \nco-occurrence in the \nqueried samples.

On the next slide is a query for IDH1, IDH2, EGFR and \nTP53 in the TCGA LGG PanCan Atlas Dataset. What happens in a regular query? \nWhat happens in a regular query? \nThis query looks for samples with alterations in IDH1, IDH2, EGFR and TP53. We \ncan see that the presence of any of four different alterations (Amplification, Deep \nDeletion, Mutation or Structural Variant) define a sample as having an alteration in \na query gene. \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nBut how were those four types of alterations selected? How do we know if an \nalteration isn\u2019t present in the data or just isn\u2019t being examined in this query? \nFor example, are there samples with shallow deletions in any of the query genes? \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nIf you hover over a gene name, you can see the specific alterations which were \nincluded in the query: \u201cMUT\u201d, \u201cFUSION\u201d, \u201cAMP\u201d, \u201cHOMDEL\u201d. These are the default \nOQL options and will highlight any mutation, fusion/structural variant, amplification \nor homozygous/deep deletion in the query gene. \nNote: Not all studies have all datatypes, for example many studies do not have fusion/structural variant calls. \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nSo let\u2019s come back to this question: are there samples with shallow deletions in \nany of the query genes? \nShallow deletions were not included in the OQL for this query, so there may be \nshallow deletions affecting these genes, but we won\u2019t see them because the query \ndidn\u2019t look for them. \nWhat if we want to include shallow deletions? How do we do that? Let\u2019s learn how \nto use OQL! The Rules of OQL \nOQL uses keywords to define the \nalterations to include in a query. \nTo the right is a table defining the \ngeneral keywords (top) and the \nmodifiers which can be applied to \ncertain keywords (bottom). The \ncomplete specifications can be \nfound here. \nLink to this page Using OQL \nLet\u2019s re-create our initial query. On the left is the query as we ran it before. On the \nright are two different ways to write the exact same query using OQL. Using OQL \nThe general format for OQL is \u201cGENE: ALTERATION1 ALTERATION2 ...\u201d. But as \nshown in the bottom example, the \u201cDATATYPES\u201d command allows a user to select \nthe same set of alterations for multiple genes all at once. \nHere each gene is listed on its \nown line, followed by a colon \nand then the list of alterations. \nRather than writing the same alterations \nafter each gene, the \u201cDATATYPES\u201d \ncommand can be used to set the \nalterations for multiple genes at once. Using OQL \nNow let\u2019s adjust the default query. Let\u2019s look for gains in EGFR and shallow \ndeletions in TP53. Add \u201cGAIN\u201d \nand \u201cHETLOSS\u201d to the query: \nOncoPrint now includes gains in EGFR and shallow deletions in TP53: \nLink to this page Using OQL \nWhat if we want to look at IDH1 R132C mutations, but no other IDH1 alteration? \nWe can specify a specific \nmutation in OQL: \nWe then see that there are many fewer samples with mutations in IDH1 since we \nhave limited the query to the relatively rare R132C. \nLink to this page Using OQL \nWe can further refine the query by removing alteration types that are not \nbiologically relevant, like deep \ndeletions in IDH2 & EGFR: \nLink to this page \nOQL Example: \nBRCA1/2 inactivation in ovarian cancer OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLoss of BRCA1 is a common event in ovarian cancer. What percentage of \nsamples lose BRCA1? Let\u2019s run a query to find out: OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Looking at OncoPrint, we can see that 12% of cases have an alteration in each of \nBRCA1 and BRCA2. However, this includes amplifications, which will not result in \na loss of function. We can use OQL to make the query more specific. \nOQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nModify the query to include only \nmutations and deep deletions: \nOncoPrint now shows a more accurate estimate of the frequency of BRCA1/2 loss: \nLink to this page OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page However, mutations and deletions are not the only way to decrease the levels of \nfunctional protein in a cell. DNA methylation can lead to decreased mRNA \nexpression. We can use the \n\u201cPlots\u201d tab to examine the \nrelationship between DNA \nmethylation and gene \nexpression. Note that the \nlower right quadrant \ncontains samples with low \nexpression and high DNA \nmethylation. We can also \nuse OQL to identify these \nsamples. OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nModify the query to also include samples with decreased expression (don\u2019t forget to \nselect \u201cmRNA Expression\u201d in \nthe \u201cGenomics Profiles\u201d section): \nOncoPrint now shows a more accurate estimate of the frequency of BRCA1 loss: \nLink to this page OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Some mutations in the OncoPrint are variants of unknown significance. Recall from \nthe Single Study Query Tutorial  that mutations are annotated as \u201cputative drivers\u201d \nor \u201cunknown significance\u201d based on this settings menu in the header: OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nWe can further refine the query by only including those mutations which are \nputative drivers, as defined by the settings menu. We can do this by: \n-Adding _DRIVER to the MUT term in OQL. This will include only mutations that \nare putative drivers (see BRCA1 below) \n-Or, replace the entire OQL string with DRIVER. This will include mutations, \nfusions/structural variant and copy number changes that are putative drivers \n(see BRCA2 below) OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Compare the result of this latest query (top) with the previous query (bottom) and \nsee that the mutations of unknown significance are no longer present. OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page This study is one of the few in cBioPortal that includes germline mutations. We can \nmake one final adjustment to our query to ask a slightly different question: what \npercentage of samples have putative driver germline mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2? \nNote that the OQL for BRCA1 and BRCA2 are equivalent as the GERMLINE term \nonly applies to mutations. OQL Example: \nRTK pathway alterations OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nAlterations in RTK signaling pathway members are common in colorectal \nadenocarcinoma. What is the pattern of alterations across the different levels of the \nsignaling pathway? \nRecall that RTKs (e.g. EGFR, \nERBB2) activate RAS (KRAS, \nNRAS, HRAS) which in turn \nactivate RAF (BRAF, ARAF, \nRAF1) which in turn activate \nMEK (MAP2K1, MAP2K2). \nLet\u2019s query all of these genes: OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page We see here an overview of each individual gene in the pathway. However, it can \nbe informative to instead see each level of the pathway grouped together. OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page We can use gene tracks to group genes together in the OncoPrint. The format is \n[\u201coptional track name\u201d GENE1 GENE2 \u2026 ]: \nOQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page Gene tracks can be combined with other OQL \nterms, either using the DATATYPES command \nas shown here, or attaching OQL to genes \nwithin the square brackets. \nNow we can clearly visualize the pattern of mutual exclusivity of driver alterations at \neach level of the pathway. OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nGene tracks can also be expanded to see tracks for individual genes. To expand, \nclick the    symbol next to the track. \nNote that OncoPrint, Mutual Exclusivity and Group Comparison are the only tabs that currently \nsupport gene tracks. All other tabs show individual genes rather than gene tracks. \nLink to this page Questions? \nCheck out the OQL specification , \nor our other tutorials, \nor email us at: \ncbioportal@googlegroups.com \n\ncBioPortal%20Tutorial%204%20Virtual%20Studies:\ncBioPortal Tutorial #4: \nVirtual Studies \nCreate and save your own custom study comprised \nof samples from existing studies \nLast update: December 23, 2021 Tutorial Objectives \n\u25cfExplain what virtual studies are and how to create them \n\u25cfDelineate the different features available when a user is or is not logged in \n\u25cfShow how to log in Virtual Study Overview \nWhat is a Virtual Study? \nA virtual study is a custom study comprised of samples from one or more existing \nstudies. \nWhy is a virtual study useful? \nThe virtual study feature allows you to define a custom cohort of samples that fit \nyour specific genomic or clinical criteria of interest. These samples can be a \nsubset of the data available in an existing study, or result from the combination of \nmultiple existing studies. This cohort of samples can then be queried or explored \njust like a traditional study, and can be returned to at a later date or shared with a \ncollaborator. In this tutorial, we will create a virtual study \ncomprised of a subset of samples from two existing \nTCGA glioma studies. \nWe begin by selecting the studies of interest and \nviewing them in the Study Summary page. Creating a virtual study: Selecting studies \n1. Use the search \nbox to find the \nstudies of interest \n2. Select the studies \nof interest \n3. Click \u201cExplore \nSelected Studies\u201d \nLink to this page Creating a virtual study: Study summary page \nClick on the       to see \nthe list of studies \nThis is the same Study Summary page that you see for a single study, but now \nwith data from 2 studies. \nLink to this page Creating a virtual study: Study summary page \nUse this table to \nselect samples with \nIDH1 mutations \n(Click the check box in the \u201c#\u201d \ncolumn, then \u201cSelect Samples\u201d at \nthe bottom of the table) In this example, we will additionally filter to samples with mutations in IDH1. \nLink to this page We are now ready to create our virtual study. \nWhat you see will differ slightly depending on if you \nare logged in or not. The next two slides show what \nthe virtual study button looks like in each scenario. \nVirtual study button (not logged in) \nEnter a name for your \nvirtual study (optional) \nClick on the link to open \nyour virtual study, or \nclick \u201cCopy\u201d to copy the \nURL to your clipboard. Text box pre-filled with \na description of the \nstudies contributing \nsamples and filters \napplied to the samples. \nYou can edit this text. \nList of studies \ncontributing to samples \nwith links to the study \nsummary for each Click here to create and \nshare your virtual study \nLink to this page \nVirtual study button (logged in) \nWhen you save a study, it is added to the \nhomepage, at the top of the study list \nunder \u201cMy Virtual Studies\u201d. Clicking \n\u201cQuery\u201d brings you to the query selector \nwith your new virtual study pre-selected. \nThe \u201cSave\u201d button only \nappears when you are \nlogged in. The \u201cShare\u201d button \nworks exactly the same \nas when not logged in \nLink to this page \nWhether or not you are logged in, let\u2019s continue \non to view this new virtual study. Virtual study: Study summary page \nWe can now see the study summary page for our newly created virtual study. You \ncan now explore these samples or run a query, just like with a traditional study. \nRemember that while making this study we filtered down to IDH1 mutant samples, but the non-mutant \nsamples were still present. Now, those samples without mutations are completely gone. \nClick on the       to see the \ndescription of this virtual study \nLink to this page Logging in to cBioPortal: \nIf you use a private instance of cBioPortal, you might \nalready go through an authentication process \n(through your university, for example). If so, there is \nnothing else you need to do. \nBut if you don\u2019t normally log in, then let\u2019s go through \nhow this works. Logging in \nLink to this page \nClick here \nLogging in \nWe use Google and Microsoft for authentication. Sign in with any Google or \nMicrosoft account. Logging in \nLink to this page \nyour email address \nHere\u2019s the virtual \nstudy I made This is what you see \nwhen you log in Virtual Study Authentication Questions \nIs it necessary to log in to use virtual studies? \nNo. A user that has not logged in can create virtual studies and run queries in \nthose studies (by using the query box on the study summary page). Links to virtual \nstudies are permanent, so you can save the link on your computer and come back \nto it anytime, or share it with others. \nIf I do log in, what additional functionality do I gain? \nIf you log in, you gain the ability to save your virtual study to the list of existing \nstudies on the homepage. This makes a virtual study functionally the same as any \nother study: you can access your virtual studies in the query builder and you can \ncombine an existing virtual study with any other study to create a new virtual \nstudy.

Q: Is there an association between alterations \nin a particular query gene and age? \nA: We can see that patients with mutations or \namplifications in EGFR tend to be older than \nthose with mutations in IDH1/IDH2 \nLink to this page Now we\u2019re going to go through all the other tabs and \nask some questions about alterations in IDH1 , IDH2  \nand EGFR  in the TCGA Lower-Grade Glioma study. \nNote: Depending on the data available for a \nparticular study, not all of the following tabs will be \npresent (e.g. a study without expression data will not \nhave a Co-expression tab) Cancer Types Summary \nHover over a bar to see \nadditional details. Histogram of the frequency of alterations in \neach gene for each detailed cancer type. \nQ: Are alterations in EGFR more frequent in a \nparticular subtype of glioma? \nA: Yes, astrocytoma appears to have a much \nhigher frequency of EGFR alteration than \noligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma. \nLink to this page Options to \ncustomize \nvisualization Plots for all \nqueried genes \ntogether and \neach individual \ngene are \navailable as \nseparate tabs. \nMutual Exclusivity \nAll pairwise \ncombinations of query \ngenes analyzed for \nmutual exclusivity or \nco-occurrence in the \nqueried samples. On the OncoPrint tab we could \nsee visually that alterations in \nthese three query genes tended to \nbe mutually exclusive. Here we \ncan address that same question \nwith a statistical analysis. \nA positive value here suggests that alterations \nin these genes co-occur in the same samples, \nwhile a negative value suggests that \nalterations in these genes are mutually \nexclusive and occur in different samples. \nlog2(                                               ) odds of alteration in B given alteration in A \nodds of alteration in B given lack of alteration in A \nLink to this page Click on any \ncolumn header to \nsort.

The Furin-like domain \nalso appears to be frequently mutated. Note \nthat these are also statistical hotspots \naccording to the OncoKB & Cancer Hotspots \ntracks and are all located in the extracellular \ndomain according to the Topology tracks. \nLink to this page Mutations \nQ: The mutations in IDH1 appear to be highly recurrent. \nAre these mutations known hotspots? Known oncogenic \ndrivers? Biomarkers for any drugs? \nA: Look at the annotation tracks below the lollipop plot and \nthe Annotation column in the table. Each mutation is \nannotated against 4 different databases with information \nabout recurrence, oncogenicity and drugability. \n     This mutation is in \nMy Cancer Genome .\n        This mutation is annotated in \nCIViC .

Co-Expression \nQ: Several genes on chr7 show high expression correlation with \nEGFR within this cohort (see table on the left). Why might that be? \nA: EGFR is also located on chr7 and is frequently gained in some \nsubtypes of glioma which could explain these correlated increases in \nexpression. This can be further explored in the \u201cCN Segments\u201d tab. \nLink to this page Comparison \nThis tab enables the comparison of all available data types between \nsamples with or without alterations in the query genes. This tab replaces \nand enhances the old \u201cEnrichments\u201d tab. \nThe Comparison tab is the same as the Group Comparison functionality \nthat is accessible from Study View. See the Group Comparison Tutorial  \nfor more details about the functionality of this tab. \nBy default, the \u201cAltered\u201d (one or more \nalterations in one or more query genes) \nand \u201cUnaltered\u201d (no alterations in any \nquery gene) groups are selected. Groups can be toggled on or off by \nclicking on them them. Analyses will \nupdate as the selections change. \nAdditional groups (deselected \nby default) correspond to each \ntrack shown in OncoPrint. \nLink to this page Comparison: Overlap \nThe Overlap subtab shows samples or patients \nthat may overlap among the selected groups. \nSelect one or more regions in the overlap \nplot to create a new group. If you are \nlogged in, this new group can be saved \nto your profile for future use. Saved \ngroups can be found under the \u201cGroups\u201d \nbutton in Study View. \nLink to this page Comparison: Survival \nLink to this page Select among \ndifferent outcome \nmeasures. Options \nhere depend on \ndata availability for \nthe study. The Survival subtab replaces the old \u201cSurvival\u201d \ntab. This subtab will only be visible if outcome data \nis available for the selected study. \nNote: These plots reflect \ndata as provided by the \nstudy. We do not perform \nany additional processing. \nQ: Do patients with alterations in \nIDH1 have different outcomes \ncompared to patients with \nalterations EGFR? \nA: Patients with alterations in IDH1 \nhave significantly better OS than \npatients with alterations in EGFR. Comparison: Clinical \nLink to this page Click on a clinical \nattribute to visualize \nthe data in the plot \non the right. The Clinical subtab compares all available clinical \ndata among the selected groups. Comparison: Molecular Profiles \nLink to this page The molecular profiles \nsubtabs replace the old \n\u201cEnrichments\u201d tab. \nThese analyses ask whether \nGenomic Alterations \n(mutations/copy-number \nalterations) or mRNA \nexpression or protein \nexpression in a particular \ngene is enriched in one of the \nselected groups. These, and \nadditional subtabs like \nMicrobiome Signature, will be \nvisible depending on the data \navailable for each study. Comparison: Molecular Profiles \nClick the checkbox next to a gene name and then click \nthis button to re-run the query with a gene added. Select sample-level or \npatient-level analysis \nClick on any column \nheader to sort. Hover \nover the column name for \nmore details about how \nvalues are calculated. Hover over a \ndot to see the \ngene name Select which types of \nalterations to include \nin the analysis \nLink to this page Comparison \nQ: Alterations in IDH1, IDH2 \nand EGFR are mutually \nexclusive but some samples \nhave alterations in none of \nthese genes. Do samples \nwithout IDH1, IDH2 or EGFR \nalterations commonly have \ngenomic alterations in one or \nmore other genes? \nA: Alterations in NF1 are \nsignificantly mutually exclusive \nwith alterations in IDH1, IDH2 \nand EGFR (see table). Try \nadding NF1 to the query (check \nthe box next to NF1 and then \nclick \u201cAdd checked genes to \nquery\u201d) and examine the \nOncoPrint and the Mutual \nExclusivity tabs. Notice the distribution of \nsamples with NF1 \nmutations relative to \nsamples with query \ngene alterations. CN Segments \nView copy number for each sample at each query \ngene via the Integrated Genomics Viewer  (IGV). \nClick      for track settings, \nincluding expanding the height \nof each sample (see below) Plots for each gene appear on a separate tab. Toggle track labels, a vertical line \nmarking the center of the viewing screen, \nand a vertical line that moves with your \ncursor.

Link to this page Example 3: Run the query \nExample 3: OncoPrint \nLink to this page In general, mutations in these genes are \nmutually exclusive. However, there\u2019s one case \nwith driver mutations in both KRAS and NRAS. \nLet\u2019s look at that patient in greater detail by \nclicking on the patient ID (\u201cTCGA-B5-A0JV\u201d). \nExample 3: Patient View \n3. Could this be related to \ndifferences in clonality? Perhaps the \nPIK3CA mutation is clonal while the \nNRAS & KRAS mutations are in two \ndistinct subclones. If that theory is \ncorrect, we would expect to see \nother mutations with similar variant \nallele frequencies. Indeed,we can \nsee that is true by looking at the \nhistogram of variant allele frequency. 2. Note that all three genes are \ndiploid, so the differences are unlikely \nto arise from copy number alteration. \nLink to this page 1. Look at the Allele Freq column for each mutation. NRAS \nQ61K (19%) and KRAS G12D (21%) have similar variant \nallele frequencies, but PIK3CA E542K is twice as high (38%). Summary of Example 3 : Using Patient View, we \ncan infer the clonality of mutations and understand \nhow two mutations, which are usually mutually \nexclusive, can be present in the same tumor sample. \nIn this case, the KRAS and NRAS mutations appear \nto be present in two distinct subclones of a single \ntumor.

On the next slide is a query for IDH1, IDH2, EGFR and \nTP53 in the TCGA LGG PanCan Atlas Dataset. What happens in a regular query? \nWhat happens in a regular query? \nThis query looks for samples with alterations in IDH1, IDH2, EGFR and TP53. We \ncan see that the presence of any of four different alterations (Amplification, Deep \nDeletion, Mutation or Structural Variant) define a sample as having an alteration in \na query gene. \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nBut how were those four types of alterations selected? How do we know if an \nalteration isn\u2019t present in the data or just isn\u2019t being examined in this query? \nFor example, are there samples with shallow deletions in any of the query genes? \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nIf you hover over a gene name, you can see the specific alterations which were \nincluded in the query: \u201cMUT\u201d, \u201cFUSION\u201d, \u201cAMP\u201d, \u201cHOMDEL\u201d. These are the default \nOQL options and will highlight any mutation, fusion/structural variant, amplification \nor homozygous/deep deletion in the query gene. \nNote: Not all studies have all datatypes, for example many studies do not have fusion/structural variant calls. \nLink to this page What happens in a regular query? \nSo let\u2019s come back to this question: are there samples with shallow deletions in \nany of the query genes? \nShallow deletions were not included in the OQL for this query, so there may be \nshallow deletions affecting these genes, but we won\u2019t see them because the query \ndidn\u2019t look for them. \nWhat if we want to include shallow deletions? How do we do that? Let\u2019s learn how \nto use OQL! The Rules of OQL \nOQL uses keywords to define the \nalterations to include in a query. \nTo the right is a table defining the \ngeneral keywords (top) and the \nmodifiers which can be applied to \ncertain keywords (bottom). The \ncomplete specifications can be \nfound here. \nLink to this page Using OQL \nLet\u2019s re-create our initial query. On the left is the query as we ran it before. On the \nright are two different ways to write the exact same query using OQL. Using OQL \nThe general format for OQL is \u201cGENE: ALTERATION1 ALTERATION2 ...\u201d. But as \nshown in the bottom example, the \u201cDATATYPES\u201d command allows a user to select \nthe same set of alterations for multiple genes all at once. \nHere each gene is listed on its \nown line, followed by a colon \nand then the list of alterations. \nRather than writing the same alterations \nafter each gene, the \u201cDATATYPES\u201d \ncommand can be used to set the \nalterations for multiple genes at once. Using OQL \nNow let\u2019s adjust the default query. Let\u2019s look for gains in EGFR and shallow \ndeletions in TP53. Add \u201cGAIN\u201d \nand \u201cHETLOSS\u201d to the query: \nOncoPrint now includes gains in EGFR and shallow deletions in TP53: \nLink to this page Using OQL \nWhat if we want to look at IDH1 R132C mutations, but no other IDH1 alteration? \nWe can specify a specific \nmutation in OQL: \nWe then see that there are many fewer samples with mutations in IDH1 since we \nhave limited the query to the relatively rare R132C. \nLink to this page Using OQL \nWe can further refine the query by removing alteration types that are not \nbiologically relevant, like deep \ndeletions in IDH2 & EGFR: \nLink to this page \nOQL Example: \nBRCA1/2 inactivation in ovarian cancer OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLoss of BRCA1 is a common event in ovarian cancer. What percentage of \nsamples lose BRCA1? Let\u2019s run a query to find out: OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Looking at OncoPrint, we can see that 12% of cases have an alteration in each of \nBRCA1 and BRCA2. However, this includes amplifications, which will not result in \na loss of function. We can use OQL to make the query more specific. \nOQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nModify the query to include only \nmutations and deep deletions: \nOncoPrint now shows a more accurate estimate of the frequency of BRCA1/2 loss: \nLink to this page OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page However, mutations and deletions are not the only way to decrease the levels of \nfunctional protein in a cell. DNA methylation can lead to decreased mRNA \nexpression. We can use the \n\u201cPlots\u201d tab to examine the \nrelationship between DNA \nmethylation and gene \nexpression. Note that the \nlower right quadrant \ncontains samples with low \nexpression and high DNA \nmethylation. We can also \nuse OQL to identify these \nsamples. OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nModify the query to also include samples with decreased expression (don\u2019t forget to \nselect \u201cmRNA Expression\u201d in \nthe \u201cGenomics Profiles\u201d section): \nOncoPrint now shows a more accurate estimate of the frequency of BRCA1 loss: \nLink to this page OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Some mutations in the OncoPrint are variants of unknown significance. Recall from \nthe Single Study Query Tutorial  that mutations are annotated as \u201cputative drivers\u201d \nor \u201cunknown significance\u201d based on this settings menu in the header: OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nWe can further refine the query by only including those mutations which are \nputative drivers, as defined by the settings menu. We can do this by: \n-Adding _DRIVER to the MUT term in OQL. This will include only mutations that \nare putative drivers (see BRCA1 below) \n-Or, replace the entire OQL string with DRIVER. This will include mutations, \nfusions/structural variant and copy number changes that are putative drivers \n(see BRCA2 below) OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page Compare the result of this latest query (top) with the previous query (bottom) and \nsee that the mutations of unknown significance are no longer present. OQL Example: BRCA1/2 inactivation \nLink to this page This study is one of the few in cBioPortal that includes germline mutations. We can \nmake one final adjustment to our query to ask a slightly different question: what \npercentage of samples have putative driver germline mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2? \nNote that the OQL for BRCA1 and BRCA2 are equivalent as the GERMLINE term \nonly applies to mutations. OQL Example: \nRTK pathway alterations OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nAlterations in RTK signaling pathway members are common in colorectal \nadenocarcinoma. What is the pattern of alterations across the different levels of the \nsignaling pathway? \nRecall that RTKs (e.g. EGFR, \nERBB2) activate RAS (KRAS, \nNRAS, HRAS) which in turn \nactivate RAF (BRAF, ARAF, \nRAF1) which in turn activate \nMEK (MAP2K1, MAP2K2). \nLet\u2019s query all of these genes: OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page We see here an overview of each individual gene in the pathway. However, it can \nbe informative to instead see each level of the pathway grouped together. OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page We can use gene tracks to group genes together in the OncoPrint. The format is \n[\u201coptional track name\u201d GENE1 GENE2 \u2026 ]: \nOQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nLink to this page Gene tracks can be combined with other OQL \nterms, either using the DATATYPES command \nas shown here, or attaching OQL to genes \nwithin the square brackets. \nNow we can clearly visualize the pattern of mutual exclusivity of driver alterations at \neach level of the pathway. OQL Example: RTK pathway alterations \nGene tracks can also be expanded to see tracks for individual genes. To expand, \nclick the    symbol next to the track. \nNote that OncoPrint, Mutual Exclusivity and Group Comparison are the only tabs that currently \nsupport gene tracks. All other tabs show individual genes rather than gene tracks. \nLink to this page Questions? \nCheck out the OQL specification , \nor our other tutorials, \nor email us at: \ncbioportal@googlegroups.com \n\ncBioPortal%20Tutorial%204%20Virtual%20Studies:\ncBioPortal Tutorial #4: \nVirtual Studies \nCreate and save your own custom study comprised \nof samples from existing studies \nLast update: December 23, 2021 Tutorial Objectives \n\u25cfExplain what virtual studies are and how to create them \n\u25cfDelineate the different features available when a user is or is not logged in \n\u25cfShow how to log in Virtual Study Overview \nWhat is a Virtual Study? \nA virtual study is a custom study comprised of samples from one or more existing \nstudies. \nWhy is a virtual study useful? \nThe virtual study feature allows you to define a custom cohort of samples that fit \nyour specific genomic or clinical criteria of interest. These samples can be a \nsubset of the data available in an existing study, or result from the combination of \nmultiple existing studies. This cohort of samples can then be queried or explored \njust like a traditional study, and can be returned to at a later date or shared with a \ncollaborator. In this tutorial, we will create a virtual study \ncomprised of a subset of samples from two existing \nTCGA glioma studies. \nWe begin by selecting the studies of interest and \nviewing them in the Study Summary page. Creating a virtual study: Selecting studies \n1. Use the search \nbox to find the \nstudies of interest \n2. Select the studies \nof interest \n3. Click \u201cExplore \nSelected Studies\u201d \nLink to this page Creating a virtual study: Study summary page \nClick on the       to see \nthe list of studies \nThis is the same Study Summary page that you see for a single study, but now \nwith data from 2 studies. \nLink to this page Creating a virtual study: Study summary page \nUse this table to \nselect samples with \nIDH1 mutations \n(Click the check box in the \u201c#\u201d \ncolumn, then \u201cSelect Samples\u201d at \nthe bottom of the table) In this example, we will additionally filter to samples with mutations in IDH1. \nLink to this page We are now ready to create our virtual study. \nWhat you see will differ slightly depending on if you \nare logged in or not. The next two slides show what \nthe virtual study button looks like in each scenario. \nVirtual study button (not logged in) \nEnter a name for your \nvirtual study (optional) \nClick on the link to open \nyour virtual study, or \nclick \u201cCopy\u201d to copy the \nURL to your clipboard. Text box pre-filled with \na description of the \nstudies contributing \nsamples and filters \napplied to the samples. \nYou can edit this text. \nList of studies \ncontributing to samples \nwith links to the study \nsummary for each Click here to create and \nshare your virtual study \nLink to this page \nVirtual study button (logged in) \nWhen you save a study, it is added to the \nhomepage, at the top of the study list \nunder \u201cMy Virtual Studies\u201d. Clicking \n\u201cQuery\u201d brings you to the query selector \nwith your new virtual study pre-selected. \nThe \u201cSave\u201d button only \nappears when you are \nlogged in. The \u201cShare\u201d button \nworks exactly the same \nas when not logged in \nLink to this page \nWhether or not you are logged in, let\u2019s continue \non to view this new virtual study. Virtual study: Study summary page \nWe can now see the study summary page for our newly created virtual study. You \ncan now explore these samples or run a query, just like with a traditional study. \nRemember that while making this study we filtered down to IDH1 mutant samples, but the non-mutant \nsamples were still present. Now, those samples without mutations are completely gone. \nClick on the       to see the \ndescription of this virtual study \nLink to this page Logging in to cBioPortal: \nIf you use a private instance of cBioPortal, you might \nalready go through an authentication process \n(through your university, for example). If so, there is \nnothing else you need to do. \nBut if you don\u2019t normally log in, then let\u2019s go through \nhow this works. Logging in \nLink to this page \nClick here \nLogging in \nWe use Google and Microsoft for authentication. Sign in with any Google or \nMicrosoft account. Logging in \nLink to this page \nyour email address \nHere\u2019s the virtual \nstudy I made This is what you see \nwhen you log in Virtual Study Authentication Questions \nIs it necessary to log in to use virtual studies? \nNo. A user that has not logged in can create virtual studies and run queries in \nthose studies (by using the query box on the study summary page). Links to virtual \nstudies are permanent, so you can save the link on your computer and come back \nto it anytime, or share it with others. \nIf I do log in, what additional functionality do I gain? \nIf you log in, you gain the ability to save your virtual study to the list of existing \nstudies on the homepage. This makes a virtual study functionally the same as any \nother study: you can access your virtual studies in the query builder and you can \ncombine an existing virtual study with any other study to create a new virtual \nstudy.

            "reasoning": "The summary should include detailed information about the purpose of the Imaging Data Commons (IDC) website, the types of data it provides, the tools available for accessing and analyzing the data, and the specific datasets and anatomical sites covered. This will help users determine if IDC is the appropriate data source for their needs.",
            "summary": "The Imaging Data Commons (IDC) is a cloud-based repository designed to provide access, visualization, and analysis of multi-modal imaging data specifically for cancer research. The primary purpose of IDC is to serve as a comprehensive resource for publicly available cancer imaging data, co-located with various tools and resources for data analysis and exploration. The IDC page offers several navigation options, including sections for About, Explore, Analyze, Submit, Publications, News, and Support, as well as links to related resources such as the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), and the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) standard. Additionally, users can access genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), proteomics data from the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and other specialized datasets from various cancer research initiatives like the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and the Lung Imaging Database Consortium (LIDC). The IDC provides a variety of imaging data types, including clinical and preclinical imaging, radiological images (e.g., CT, MRI, PET), digital pathology images, multispectral microscopy images, image annotations, parametric maps derived from images, measurements derived from images, and expert assessments of image findings. Users can filter data by anatomical sites such as bladder, bone marrow, brain, breast, colon, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, rectum, skin, and uterus. For data access, IDC offers both interactive and programmatic download options. The interactive download is facilitated through the 3D Slicer SlicerIDCBrowser extension, which allows users to explore and download IDC data directly into the 3D Slicer application for visualization and analysis. The programmatic download is supported by the idc-index Python package, which simplifies access to IDC data through a set of API functions for exploring, searching, selecting, and downloading files. The IDC also provides detailed documentation and tutorials to assist users in utilizing these tools effectively. Overall, the IDC is a robust and versatile resource for researchers seeking comprehensive cancer imaging data and associated analytical tools."

CDS \ncurrently hosts a variety of data types from NCI projects and programs such as the \nHuman Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), Division of Cancer Control and Population \nSciences (D CCPS), and Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI), as well as data from \nindependent research projects.  \nCDS provides data -sharing capabilities for additional studies that fall under the following \ncategories:  \n\u2022 Studies with data that do not match any existing CRDC data commons  \n\u2022 Studies with data that do not fit current data type criteria for any CRDC data \ncommons  \nStudies with data that are on a waiting list to become part of  a CRDC Submission  must \nfollow  the steps  described  in \u201cHow to Submit Data \u201d on page 2.  \nSearching the data housed in CDS is easy to do through the Data page, which has a filter \nfunction to find data by categories.  \nAccess to c ontrolled data requires approval from the NIH Data Access Committee  \nthrough the dbGaP  process . 2 Open -access data is publicly accessible  and does not require any approvals. Being a \ncloud repository, CDS does not facilitate direct downloads of data, owing to high data \ndownload charges. However, programs/initiatives can reach out to the CDS Help Desk  to \nrequest downloads if they are willing to fund download s by users approved to access \ntheir data. Please contact the CDS helpdesk for more  information.  \nAccess to data in CDS for review and/or analysis is through the NCI\u2019s Cloud Resource, \nVelsera Cancer Genomics Cloud  (Velsera /CGC)  (formerly Seven Bridges).

Contact the CDS Helpdesk email  with questions or comments . \nc. When CDS receives  the completed New Request Questionnaire , they \nschedule  a data intake interview . It takes one week from the time the \nquestionnaire is received to the time the CDS team schedules an hour -long \ninterview . \n3. Discuss the following at the i nitial interview : \na. Questionnaire responses   \nb. Steps taken to de -identify the data  for PHI/PII  \nc. Requirements for d ata storage  and sharing  \nd. CDS Metadata Template  3 e. Review pre -requisites , including  the dbGaP process , if appropriate . \n4. Approval  \na. CDS notif ies the submitter about approval to submit data . This might take \na week if new data types or new requirements are included.  \n5. Submi tter submits  the following : \na. Complete  and Final metadata manifest  \nb. List of Authorized Data Uploaders  (this includes data uploader name/s, \nemail/s ) \n6. Once CDS receives  the Complete and Final metadata manifest, CDS creates Cloud \nBuckets . \na. CDS sends credentials (for uploader , submission POC, PI). This can take up \nto one week . \n7. The s ubmitter upload s data into the CDS  bucket using the provided credentials . \n8. The s ubmitter notifies CDS when submission is complete . \na. CDS locks the bucket , making it read -only . \n9. CDS begins indexing  studies . \n\u2022 This process takes 6 to 8 weeks . \n\u2022 The process includes indexing and authentication and authorization (the \nprocess of data ingestion for release) . \n\u2022 CDS releases the study  data  for secondary sharing on  the CDS page on \nVelsera /CGC (provide link).  \n\u2022 CDS will try to align the release dates with the dbGaP release schedule as \nmuch as possible . \n\u2022 The dbGaP study page provides a link to CDS . Data can be explored on the \nCDS portal and the CDS page on Velsera /CGC . \n10. Access  the controlled access data on Velsera /CGC, from dbGaP . \na. Go to d bGaP and search for the study of interest . \n\u2022 On the dbGaP study page you are redirected to the CDS Data \nCommons page. \n\u2022 Note that t he data is s earchable via  Velsera/CGC  (formerly known \nas SBG-CGC ). \nb.

            "reasoning": "The summary should include detailed information about the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) and its Cancer Data Service (CDS) repository, as this will help users understand the type of data available, how to access it, and the processes involved in data submission and analysis. This information is crucial for determining if this data source is appropriate for a user's specific data query.",
            "summary": "The Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) is a comprehensive platform designed to provide secure and flexible storage and sharing of data for NCI-funded studies. The Cancer Data Service (CDS) is a key repository within the CRDC, specifically catering to studies that do not match existing CRDC data commons or do not meet current data type criteria and metadata standards. The CDS offers a variety of data types from NCI projects and programs such as the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), and Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI), as well as data from independent research projects. It supports data-sharing capabilities for additional studies that fall under specific categories, including those that do not fit current data type criteria or are on a waiting list to become part of a CRDC submission. The CDS portal provides a user-friendly interface for exploring, accessing, and analyzing data. Users can navigate through various sections such as the Data Types section, Data Submission section, Data Access section, and Data Analysis section. The portal also includes links to specific studies and data, tools and resources for data analysis, and support pages for assistance. Data housed in CDS can be searched using various metadata elements, and access to controlled data requires approval from the NIH Data Access Committee through the dbGaP process. Open-access data is publicly accessible without any approvals. The CDS does not facilitate direct downloads of data due to high data download charges, but programs can request downloads if they are willing to fund them. Data analysis is supported through the NCI\u2019s Cloud Resource, Velsera Cancer Genomics Cloud (formerly Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud), which provides tools and resources for analyzing CDS data. The data submission process involves several steps, including completing a New Request Questionnaire, scheduling a data intake interview, and submitting a metadata manifest. Once approved, data is uploaded to a cloud S3 bucket, indexed, and made available through the CRDC. The indexing process can take 6 to 8 weeks. The CDS also provides a GraphQL interface for querying data, with several example queries available in the CDS User Guide. Overall, the CDS is a robust resource for researchers looking to store, share, and analyze cancer research data, offering a wide range of data types and comprehensive support for data submission and access."

            "reasoning": "The summary should include detailed information about the Ensembl REST API, its purpose, the types of data it provides, and the specific endpoints available. This will help users determine if this data source is appropriate for their genomic data needs.",
            "summary": "The Ensembl REST API webpage serves as a comprehensive resource for accessing a wide range of genomic data through various REST API endpoints. The primary purpose of this page is to provide documentation and facilitate access to Ensembl's genomic data, which includes information on gene trees, homology, cross-references, and species-specific data. Users can navigate to the Ensembl homepage, access a list of available API endpoints, read the user guide, view the change log, learn about the Ensembl project, contact support, and read the privacy notice from this page.\n\nThe webpage is structured into several sections, each dedicated to different types of genomic data. The 'Archive' section includes endpoints for retrieving identifier versions, while the 'Comparative Genomics' section offers endpoints for accessing gene trees and homology information. The 'Cross References' section provides endpoints for looking up external symbols and identifiers. The 'Information' section includes endpoints for retrieving various types of genomic data, such as analyses, assemblies, biotypes, and species information.\n\nSpecific links on the webpage direct users to various resources, including the Ensembl main website, the REST API endpoints, the user guide, the change log, and information about the Ensembl project. Detailed documentation is available for each endpoint, such as retrieving the latest version of a given identifier, accessing gene trees using stable identifiers, retrieving genomic alignments based on region and species, and looking up external symbols to return all linked Ensembl objects.\n\nThe Ensembl REST API also provides example clients in multiple programming languages (Java, Perl, Python, Ruby) to help users get started with querying the API. The API supports various features such as rate limiting, cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), JSON-P, and version migration. The data returned by the service is subject to the same conditions as laid out on the Ensembl website, and users are encouraged to cite relevant publications when using the API in their work.\n\nOverall, the Ensembl REST API webpage is a valuable resource for researchers and developers seeking programmatic access to a wide array of genomic data, with extensive documentation and support to facilitate its use."

PCORnet\u00ae Network Partners perform rigorous work upfront that enables users to ask the same question to millions of people across the United States simultaneously, with fast answers delivered in a single, standardized format.\n\nData Sources\n\nData accessible via the PCORnet distributed network draw from millions of electronic health records (EHRs) with growing links to patient-reported and payor data to create a powerful, standard data set that facilitates large-scale, multi-site research.\n\nData Resources\n\nPCORnet\u00ae Network Partners have developed policies and other critical documentation to ensure the quality, facilitate the accessibility, and govern the use of the PCORnet\u00ae Common Data Model and resources.\n\n>30 Million in the Network\n\nPCORnet represents data from everyday healthcare encounters with more than 30 million people across the U.S. each year.\n\nClick to enlarge or download\n\nData Quality\n\nAll PCORnet-accessible data are rigorously screened in a two-stage process. The first stage examines data for conformance, or adherence to the standard organization and representation of data for PCORnet; completeness, including that diagnosis codes are aligned; plausibility to ensure that the values make logical sense; and persistence to ensure that records are not disappearing between refreshes.\n\nThe second stage of curation establishes the level of data quality for a specific study purpose. The Coordinating Center for PCORnet\u00ae examines accessible data for patterns to identify potential quality concerns for key variables within a given study or population. As a result, the strengths and weaknesses of data available via PCORnet for specific research use are well known and communicated with transparency at the outset of every research effort.\n\nData Security and Privacy\n\nA key security feature of the PCORnet infrastructure is that the data stay with each network partner behind its firewall protected under HIPAA and are not amassed into a single data pool or data warehouse. Queries and responses are enabled via a secure Distributed Research Network Query Portal. The system includes strong governance, role-based access controls, and auditing. The PCORnet-enabled approach shares only the minimum necessary information needed to answer a question. Researchers\u2019 queries are sent to the data \u2014 and answers, not data, are sent back to researchers.\n\nView the Statement on Data Privacy.\n\nContinuous, Open-Source Learning Model\n\nThe process for readying data from sites participating in PCORnet for research is one of continuous improvement. As the PCORnet\u00ae Network Partners build knowledge around EHR use for research purposes, they are constantly refining and evolving. Improving the nation\u2019s public health is a core motivator in the development of PCORnet, which is why PCORnet data curation learnings are shared on GitHub, an open source project accessible to all.\n\nPCORnet\u00ae Common Data Model\n\nMulti-site Research, Simplified\n\nBecause every PCORnet\u00ae Network Partner operates under a shared PCORnet\u00ae Common Data Model, users can ask the same question to millions of patients simultaneously and receive a clear answer, even across disparate systems.\n\nThe strength of the PCORnet infrastructure is that it enables researchers to quickly capture data insights from a large network of clinical information systems at once, which has historically been challenging. That\u2019s because each of these systems code and define data slightly differently from one another. A clinic might code birthdate as \u201cDate_of_Birth,\u201d a health system might call it \u201cBirth_DT,\u201d and a health registry might use the code \u201cDOB.\u201d\n\nThe PCORnet\u00ae Common Data Model, developed by the PCORnet\u00ae Network Partners, solves this challenge by standardizing millions of data points from the Network\u2019s diverse clinical information systems into a common format. As a result, users of PCORnet can ask the same question simultaneously to hundreds of disparate systems and receive a clear, reliable answer.\n\nPCORnet\u00ae Common Data Model v6.1 Parseable Spreadsheet Format (03 April 2023)\n\nDownload Parseable Spreadsheet\n\nPCORnet\u00ae Common Data Model v6.1 Specification (03 Apr 2023)\n\nDownload Common Data Model\n\nPCORnet Data Checks v15 (Effective January 2024)\n\nDownload Data Checks\n\nPCORnet\u00ae Common Data Model Value Set Reference File v1.13 (03 April 2023)\n\nDownload Value Set Reference File",

The  Implementation Guidance is intended to help reduce the  \nvar\niability in how network partners populate their  CDM datamarts.  It provides recommendations and preferred approaches when there are multiple interpretations of the CDM specification or if  \nthere is unexpected complexity in a partner\u2019s source data.   The  Implementation Guidance is intended to be a living document, and as such, will be updated more frequently than the CDM  \nspecification  itself .  \nTo accommodate the addition of this material, the CDM page size has been increased from US Letter to US Legal (8.50\u201dx14\u201d).

Introduction  \nWhat is the CDM? \nThe PCORnet Common Data Model (CDM)  \nis a \nspecification that defines a standard organization and representation of data for the  \nPCORnet Distributed Research Network.  \nThe PCORnet CDM is a key component of the PCORnet Distributed Research Network (DRN) infrastructure. PCORnet developed the PCORnet DRN to be a \u201c\u2026functional distributed research \nnetwork that facilitates multi-site patient\u2013centered research across the Clinical Research Networks (CRNs) and other interested contributors. The distributed network will enable the conduct of observational research and clinical trials while allowing each participating organization to maintain physical and operational control over its data.\u201d [Data Standards, Security, and Network Infrastructure Task Force (DSSNI charter), 2014] For more details of CDM development, additional references include: \n\u2022 CDM abstracts presented at scientific conferences: https://github.com/CDMFORUM/CDM -GUIDANCE/wiki/CDM -related -Abstracts \n2.3.  History of  Releases and  Modifications  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 4 of 210 Note on version conventions: Major releases are denoted in  whole number increment s (e.g., v1.0, v2.0, v3.0). Minor releases are denoted with decimal increment s (e.g., v1.1, v1.2) and will be \nused for bug fixes and minor adjustments.

Implementation Expectations \nPartners should populate all core CDM tables if data are available in their source system(s). All core CDM tables must be present in an instantiation of the CDM , even if the table is empty. \nThis is important because some components of the querying platform need to locate a given table, even if zero records are pre sent in that table. The fields that are required to be populated for all \nrecords in a given table are listed in the \u201cconstraints\u201d section of each table description.  Any  table and/or field in the CDM may be required for a partner\u2019s participation in a given study or other \nPCORnet activity. In assessing  foundational data quality,  the PCORnet Data Curation query packages may query any CDM table or field ( except for PRIVATE tables) .  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 10 of 210     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n \n   \n  \n  \n    \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                                 \n  3.  Design of the CDM \n3.1.  Special Topics for CDM Modeling \nPrioritization of Analytic Functionality \nPCORnet CDM Guiding Principle  #5 states,  \n\u201cDocumentation will be clear and transparent so that its contents are \nunderstandable to all contributors. The CDM will be intuitive and easy for \nanalysts and investigators to use. Investigators and analysts with prior experience using research data will not need additional skills or \nknowledge to use the CDM.\u201d [emphasis added] \nThis guiding principle is expressed in the CDM design through prioritization of analytic functionality, and a parsimonious approach based upon analytic utility. At times, this results in decisions \nthat are not based in relational database modeling principles such as normalization. The model is designed to facilitate routine and rapid execution of distributed complex analytics. To meet this design requirement, some fields are duplicated across multiple tables to support faster analytic operations for distributed querying. The PCORnet CDM is based on the FDA Mini-Sentinel CDM. This allows PCORnet to more easily leverage the large array of analytic tools and expertise developed for the MSCDM v4.0, including data characterization approaches and the various tools for complex distributed analytics. \nRelational Integrity \nDatabase programmers will notice that fields used as primary/foreign keys, especially PATID and ENCOUNTERID, are specified as text instead of numbers. This approach, informed by prior experience in developing large-scale multi-site distributed networks, makes it easier to implement than requiring new key generation that could impact database management within source systems. \nPlease note that all tables must be present in an instantiation of the CDM, even if data are not populated in every table. \nDate Formatting \nBecause the PCORnet CDM is intended to support multiple Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), date format consistency is an issue, given that most RDBMS\u2019s have platform- specific native date representation.  \nTo address this issue, each RDBMS will  be expected to implement its own native date data type  for dates, which will be supported by the Entity  Framework technology stack1. The CDM  will  \nalways separate date fields and time fields for consistency, and employ  a naming convention of suffix \u201c_DATE\u201d  or \u201c_TIME\u201d.    \nAll times should be recorded within the local time zone. A uniform time stamp or GMT offset is not expected.  \n1  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef.aspx \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 11 of 210         \n     \n \n  \n  \n   \n    \n \n  \n \n    \n     \n \n      \n    \n   \n \n \n  \n      \n \n1.   \n2.     \n3.     \n4.     \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n     A SAS date is different from an RDBMS date. A SAS date is a value that represents the number of days between January 1, 1960 and the specified date. SAS can perform calculations on dates \nranging from A.D. 1582 to A.D. 19,900. Dates before January 1, 1960, are negative numbers; dates after are positive numbers. (Guidance added in v3.1.) \nNumber Formatting \nSAS Number fields have a byte l ength of 8 [SAS Numeric(8)].  This corresponds to an 8- byte floating -point number of approximately 16 significant digits.  When deciding on the precision/scale \nf\nor their RDBMS Number fields, partners should ensure that they do not store numbers in a way that would overflow the SAS numeric data type, which would result in a loss of data when \ngenerating a SAS dataset from the RDBMS.  RDBMS Number can be implemented as any appropriate RDBMS number concept, such as DECIMAL or DOUBLE data types. Although some RDBMS\u2019s have a specific data type called \u201cNUMBER\u201d (such as Postgres), the CDM does not imply that this specific data type should be implemented. \nWhen deciding on the parameters to choose for their RDBMS number fields, network partners should choose a combination that does not result in additional, artificial decimal precision. For \nex\nample: \n\u2022 The value 1. 1 should never  be modified to become 1.10000000 \n\u2022 The integer value of 1 should never be modified to become 1.0 or 1.00000000 \nInstead of specifying a pre cision (total number of digits) and scale (digits to the right of a decimal point) for RDBMS Number data types , the CDM spec has been revised to just read \u201cRDBMS \nNumber.\u201d  Partners should specify the parameters that are most appropriate for their RDBMS that that does not cause a loss of data when generating SAS datasets from the RDBMS or nor result \nin additional, artificial decimal precision. \nMissing or Unknown Data Values \nThe PCORnet CDM will use the HL7 conventions of \u201cNull Flavors\u201d ( https://terminology.hl7.org/1.0.0/CodeSystem-v3-NullFlavor.html http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/v3/NullFlavor /) \na\ns a basis for representing missing or unknown values in all tables except for the LAB_HISTORY table . Specifically, for fields where an enumeration is present (i.e., a categorical set of values), \nwe will populate null values as follows: \nA data field is not present  in the source system. (populate with null) \nA data field for an enumer ation is present in the source system, but the source value is null or blank. (populate with NI=No Information) \nA data field for an enumeration is present in the source system, but the source value explicitly denotes an unknown value . (populate with UN=Unknown) \nA data field for an enumeration is present in the source system, but the source value cannot be mapped to the CDM . (populate with OT=Other) \nThis guidance is only applicable for categorical text fields, not for numbers or dates. \nSource Data Consistency \nThe CDM does not include data consistency rules or edits, such as upper and lower limits of numeric values. The value recorded in the originating source system should be the value populated in  \nt\nhe CDM, even if the value is outside a normally acceptable limit. Inclusion of all originating data, without modification, supports data characterization and better data provenance.  \nDecisions about inclusion (or censoring) of outlier values will be made as part of each analysis or query, allowing for these decisions to be driven by appropriateness for each individual analysis.  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 12 of 210      \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n \n       \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n PCORnet CDM Guiding Principle  #7 states,\n\u201cThe CDM will reflect variables and values found in the local data. If \nsome data are coded in a way that is unique to a site, mapping the data to a \nstandardized format will be necessary. Values in the source data before \nmapping will also be included in the CDM. Derived variables should be \navoided.\u201d [emphasis added] \n\u201cRaw\u201d Fields \nThe data model uses a convention for \u201craw data fields.\u201d These are optional fields for storing the originating source value of a field, prior to mapping into PCORnet CDM value set. It may also be  \nused for source-specific ontologies.  The \u201cRAW\u201d fields are intended to support data provenance and facilitate quality control checking by local implementation, if desired. These fields will have a naming convention of prefix  \u201c\nRAW_\u201d. We will not include these fields in the Entity -Relationship (ER) diagram.  \nThe data model uses  a convention for \u201craw data fields.\u201d In general, these fields are used to store the  originating source value, prior to mapping into PCORnet CDM value set. They  may also be \nus\ned for source- specific ontologies.  For tables that may contain  narrative or textual results (e.g., LAB_RESULT_CM, CONDITION), the \u201cRAW\u201d field can be used to store result values that  \nwould be used in queries  or other analyses.  Partners should not use RAW fields to store internal record IDs.  \nThe \u201cRAW\u201d fields  are inten ded to support data provenance and may be queried by the DRN OC or  others to facilitate quality  assurance activities.  These fields will have  a naming convention of  \np\nrefix \u201cRAW_\u201d.   Partners are encouraged to populate as many RAW fields as possible, but if there are concerns that specific  records or fields may contain PHI, those values should be excluded.  \nHowever,  we discourage the complete exclusion of RAW field values from  the CDM ,  as that will limit  PCORnet\u2019s  ability to assess data quality.    \nCase Sensitivity All RDBMS implementations are case -sensitive. Schema implementations for Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL should be in uppercase (table name, column names, etc.).  Value \ns\net codes should reflect the case formatting in the CDM specification and/or Value Set Reference File.  \nAvoidance of Padding Numbers should not be \u201cpadded\u201d with extra zeroes. Text fields should not be \u201cpadded\u201d with spaces before or after the actual t extual values. \nAdditional Fields PCORnet sites are welcome to include additional fields in their local CDM implementation that will assist with transformation or clarity. \nAs stated in PCORnet CDM Guiding Principle  #8,\n\u201cCRN s may include additional domains and data elements in localized \nversions of the PCORnet CDM.\u201d \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 13 of 210     \n    \n \n \n     \n     \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n    \n      \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n      \n     \n      \n \n \n \n \n    \n   Incomplete Date Guidance \nIn situations where the exact day or month is unknown or not available, it is still necessary to have a valid date for native RDBMS and SAS date data types. In this situation, please use this s\npecific imputation strategy: \n\uf0a7If the day is missing, use the first day of the month to create a valid date value with the existing month and year. \n\uf0a7In the uncommon situation where a month is missing, use January 1 to create a value date value with the existing year. \nThe HARVEST table indicators of DATE_ fields are used to indicate the presence of incomplete dates within the data, and the specific details of imputation would be described in the extract -\ntransform -load ( ETL) Annotated Data Dictionary (ADD). The convention of the RAW_ fields can also be deployed to indicate the presence and original value of incomplete dates, if desired. \nExpanded value sets \nVersion 4.0 of the PCORnet CDM introduced the concept of expanded value sets for fields with dozens or hundreds of allowable options (e.g., LAB_RESULT_CM.RESULT_UNIT, \nP\nRESCRIBING.RX_DOSE_FORM ).  To reduce the size of the CDM specification document, these value sets are provided in a supplementary Value Set Reference File, which is co-located \nwith the CDM specification on the PCORnet web site ( https://pcornet.org/data/). It is expected that these value sets will only be updated as part of a CDM version update, but there may be \nex\ntenuating circumstances where an out -of-sequence update is required. For each value set, we list the raw/expected source value and the corresponding analytics -friendly string to be used when \npopulating the CDM.    \nSupplemental tables Version 4.0 of the PCORnet CDM also formalize d the concept of \u201csupplemental\u201d CDM tables.  These are tables outside of the core CDM that used to support study- specific activities that involve \nt\nhe participation of many network partners.  These table definitions may be managed in separate document(s) outside of the core CDM specification and may be refined out of cycle with the rest \nof the CDM.  Over time, some of these tables may be promoted to the core CDM, at which point they will be governed by the versioning processes of the core.  Network partners are not expected \nto populate these tables unless they are participating in a study that utilizes them. \n3.2.   Development Notes \nPCORnet CDM Guiding Principle  #2 states,  \n\u201cIt is expected that  n ot all  CRNs  will have data needed to populate all  \nparts of the  PCORnet CDM.  It is the responsibility of the  CRN s to \ncommunicate availability of each data  domain and element.\u201d  [emphasis added]  \nThe PCORnet CDM will be implemented in phases. This will allow incorporation of new data domains and fields throughout the life of the project, building based on PCORnet needs, lessons \nlearned from use, and data availability. The assessment of considerations and tradeoffs is an integral part of decision-making based on pragmatism and analytic value. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 14 of 210 Review of \nConsiderations \n& Tradeoffs Resources/expertise \navailable to \nstandardize the data \nAvailability of Data \nElements within a \ngiven domain Time required to \nstandardize the data \nto the CDM Utility & Quality of \nData for PCORnet \nResearch \nBecause the PCORnet DRN has independent objectives and priorities, the PCORnet CDM will not reuse an existing data model, but will develop a stand-alone PCORnet CDM based on existing \ndata models, as appropriate. \nPCORnet CDM Guiding Principle #6 states, \n\u201cOther common data elements and common data model initiatives exist. \nP\nCORnet will draw from the experience of others within and outside of \nPCORI, leveraging existing successful approached and data model \ndefinitions wherever possible.\u201d \nThe model was initia lly informed by results from the PCORnet DSSNI Preliminary Partner Survey (also known as the \u201cTech Survey\u201d) completed in December 2013 and January 2014. \nRecommendations from the PCORnet CDM Working Group have been a basis for strategy and decisions. The PCORnet CDM priority data domains and implementation approach are based on \nPCORI needs, planned future capabilities, and the data sources and expertise of the PCORnet partners. \nAs stated in PCORnet CDM Guiding Principle #4, \n\u201cThe PCORnet CDM will be developed in a modul ar, incremental, and \nextensible fashion. New types of data will be needed, or newly available, \nduring the life of PCORnet. Data domains and data elements will be added, \nrevised, and deprecated throughout an iterative CDM lifecycle.\u201d [emphasis \nadded] \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 15 of 210      \n \n      \n    \n  \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n \n     \n \n     \n \n        \n     \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n  3.3.  Comments on Protected Health Information (PHI) \nThe CDM will contain some of the 18 elements that define PHI under HIPAA, including encounter dates and date of birth. However, these dates will remain under the control of the institutions \nthat already maintain PHI. To maximize analytic flexibility and allow for all types of analyses, complete and exact dates should be included in the CDM. Distributed analytic programs will use the date fields for analysis, but will generate results that contain the minimum necessary information to address the question. The results returned to the requester will typically be aggregated and not include any PHI. Queries that generate results sets with PHI (e.g., a person-level analysis under an IRB, with all necessary data agreements in place) will be clearly flagged as such and will only be distributed with the appropriate approvals clearly documented. As with all distributed queries, sites should review all results before release. \nPCORnet Distributed Research Network Guiding Principle  #2 states,   \n\u201cCRNs will control how their data are used as allowed by internal \ngovernance policies. Data resources developed for PCORnet will stay \nwithin the CRN s and under their control.\u201d [emphasis added] \nThe necessary \u201ccross -walks\u201d between the arbitrary identifiers included in the CDM and their originating data are not specified in the scope of the CDM, but are expected to be maintained by each \ndata partner. \n\uf0a7PATID is a pseudoidentifier with a consistent crosswalk to the true identifier retained by the source site. For analytical data sets requiring patient -level data, only the pseudoidentifier is used to link across \na\nll information belonging to a patient. \n\uf0a7The PATID pseudoidentifier should not be a true identifier. It is not appropriate to use Medical Record Identifiers (MRNs) for this purpose because MRN is a direct patient identifier. \n\uf0a7Locally maintained \u201cmapping tables\u201d are tables necessary to implement so that each data partner has the ability to map arbitr ary identifie rs back to the originating data and patient. \nThese mapping tables are not part of the PCORnet DRN.  Mapping tables for implementation of the CDM should include (but are not limited to):  \n\uf0a7PATID crosswalk \n\uf0a7PROVIDER crosswalk \nPRIVATE tables \nVersion 4.0 of the PCORnet CDM introduced the concept of \u201cPRIVATE\u201d tables , which are intended to provide standardized representations for the commonly-used PHI elements that are \nn\necessary for certain analytic activities  (e.g., patient linkage, geocoding). These tables will not be directly queried by the DRN OC and can remain physically and logically separate from the rest \nof the CDM.  These tables will initially be developed as Supplemental tables through the process described in Section 3.1. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/\t Page 16 of 210 3.4.

Implementation Guidance \nImplementation Guidance is intended to help reduce the variability in how partners populate their CDM datamarts.  It provides recommendations and describes preferred approaches when there \nare mu ltiple interpretations of the CDM specifications or if there is unexpected complexity in a partner\u2019s source data.  The Implementation Guidance is divided into three sections, plus a set of \nreference tables: \n1.\t General guidance : The guidance applies to more than 1 CDM table/domain. These items are included in this section of the CDM Specification. \n2.\t Table-level guidance : The guidance applies to the table/domain in general or applies to more than one field in the table.  Table -level guidance is provided in each table\u2019s description before the table \ns\npecification. \n3.\t Field -level guidance : The guidance applies to implementation decisions that are specific to a given field in a table.  Field -level guidance is provided as an extra column in the CDM table specification. \n4.\t Reference tables: When applicable, reference tables have been created to provide additional guidance to network partners. \nGuidance updated as part of a major CDM revision is highlighted in green .  Guidance updated between major CDM versions is highlight ed in yellow . \nGENERAL Implementation Guidance (spans more than 1 table) \nTopic Guidance \n1 \u2013 Population of RAW fields If a  given record/observation can be directly mapped into the PCORnet CDM, there is no need to populate the RAW values.  RAW  values  \nmay be used when partners need to employ a mapping in order to populate  a given table (e.g., converting local diagnosis codes to ICD-9 or  \nICD-10, mapping internal procedure codes to one  of the specified PCORnet procedure terminologies or converting several doz en race values  \nto the values specified in the PCORnet CDM).  Populating the RAW fields is optional, but if a partner chooses to do so, they  should use the  \nfollowing strategy: \n\u2022  If there is a 1:1  relationship between the source value and the CDM, the RAW value can  be populated on the same record.    \nIn cases where there is a 1:many relationship for multiple records that are part of encounter or have the same timestamp (e.g ., 3 loca l \ndiagnosis codes recorded in the same encounter that map to a single ICD9 code), all of the local values should be concatenated into a single \nRAW observation, with the values separated by  a  pipe delimiter (\u201c|\u201d).  This prevents the creation of  duplicate records in the PCORnet CDM.  \n2 \u2013 Date Obfuscation and/or \nTruncation Do not include shifted or truncated dates within the CDM, with the exception of birth date for patients >89, if required by l ocal regulations.  \nAggregate or de -identified queries that return age for patients >89 will appropriately bucket the results before they are returned. \n3 \u2013 Patients with age > 89 PCORnet queries issued by the DRN OC will bucket all patients age 90+ into one age group to limit the risk of re -identification. Some \npartners \u2019 local regulatory restrictions may require additional protection of date -related data on patients age > 89. For example, some partners \nmight be asked to remove the birth date while others might require that it be shifted to mask the patient\u2019s true date of  birth.  If the birth date \nmust be shifted , these regulatory restrictions would subsequently prevent the same shift from being applied to the rest of the patient\u2019s dat es \nof service, resulting in inconsistencies in the data (see General Guidance #2).  In this case, partners should consider shifting the value in the DEMOGRAPHIC.BIRTH_DATE field for these patients to a dummy date of January 1, 1900.  If this approach is taken, partners should structure their ETL to shift birth dates from patients currently over 89, as well as those that will \u201cage out\u201d and turn 89 before the next \nexpected datamart refresh. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/\t Page 18 of 210     \n  \n  \n     \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n  \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n     \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n  \n    \n GENERAL Implementation Guidance (spans more than 1 table)  \nTopic Guidance \n4 \u2013 Mapping source data to \nstandard terminologies when \nmultiple options exist Some partners with Epic EHRs are able to access diagnoses/problem list entries coded via vocabulary mapping software/middleware (e.g., \nIMO).   Such software/middleware provides mappings to multiple terminologies, so partners have several options from which to choose \nwhen populating their datamart. \nPartners should utilize the vocabulary or terminology that most closely reflects the standard typically used to encode data in that domain at \nthe time the observation was recorded.  For instance, diagnosis codes would use ICD-9 before October 2015, and ICD- 10 afterwards ; \nprocedure co des would be encoded in CPT/HCPCS or in ICD-9 before October 2015 and in CPT/HCPCS or ICD-10 afterwards; p roblem \nlist values would be encoded in SNOMED.  This will allow partners to avoid the potential duplication of records (e.g., if com bining facility \nbilling diagnoses coded in ICD with professional diagnoses coded in SNOMED or mapping the same EHR record to ICD-9 and ICD-10) and more readily allow the application of existing validated algorithms. In these situations, the original codes can be retained  within the RAW \nfields to allow for additional studies that seek to execute exploratory analyses using alternative mappings.  This guidance m ay be revised in \nthe future to incorporate the published findings of subsequent validation studies that compare the downstream analytical results that arise from various mapping strategies.     \n5 \u2013 Approach when there are \nknown errors or missingness in TYPE fields (e.g., PROCEDURES.PX_TYPE, LAB_RESULT_CM.LAB_RES ULT_PX_TYPE, ENCOUNTER.DRG_TYPE, or DIAGNOSIS.DX_TYPE) The PCORnet CDM Guiding Principles ask that data from source systems be populated in the CDM \u201cas is.\u201d However, some fields in t he \nCDM that are used to identify attributes about the data, such as the TYPE fields, are critical to the operation of the PCORne t analytic \nqueries.  If the TYPE field is incorrect, the query will end up using a mismatched code set and return invalid/empty results.  If the errors in the source for the TYPE fields are systemic (e.g., an interface reports all procedure billing codes as I CD-10, when they are really a mix of \nICD-10 and CPT), and the partner is able to isolate and rectify the issue, then the preference is that these data be cleaned befo re populating \nthe CDM.  The same guidance applies if TYPE fields are not populated or are not transmitted from the source system.  The heuristic or algorithm used by the partner should be documented in their ETL ADD.  If there are known systemic issues in other fields or domains, these \ndata should not be cleaned, but partners should make every attempt to resolve or rectify the issue within their source system(s) . Any known \nsystemic issues should also be documented in the ETL ADD. \n6 \u2013 Corrected/updated source \nvalues If a measure/laboratory result has been corrected in the source system, and bot h the original and corrected values are present in the source \nsystem, partners should only include the corrected (e.g., most recent) value in their CDM datamart.  If a measure/laboratory result is \nincluded in their CDM datamart that has later been found to be canceled, partners should remove that value from their CDM datamart in \nsubsequent refreshes. \n7 \u2013  Precision/scale for RDBMS  \nNUMBER fields  This guidance has been deprecated as of  CDM v3.1.  \n8 \u2013 Study -specific datamart \nrestrictions The DRN OC will work w ith networks that operate using a centralized model to ensure that site -specific results are available for all queries \nin the same fashion as distributed data marts. \n9 \u2013  PATIDs  & other  IDs  To the extent possible,  Partners should maintain PATIDs  and all other  ID fields (ENCOUNTERID,  DIAGNOSISID,  PROVIDERID,  etc.)  \nacross refreshes.   In addition, the lengths of these fields should be harmonized across  all tables to facilitate cross-table querying  (see General  \nGuidance #18).  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 19 of 210     \n  \n  \n \n     \n   \n     \n \n \n   \n   \n  \n \n   \n      \n    \n  \n     \n     \n     \n  \n   \n   \n  \n \n      \n \n   GENERAL Implementation Guidance (spans more than 1 table) \nTopic Guidance \n10 \u2013 Units of Measure Starting with PCORnet CDM v4.0, the value set for  the units of measure  fields  (e.g., RESULT_UNIT in LAB_RESULT_CM, OBSGEN  \nand CLINOBS OBSCLIN , and *_STRENGTH_*_ UNIT in PRESCRIBING, DISPENSING and MED_ADMIN) has been expanded to \ninclude values from the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM).  The value set in the Value Set Reference File reflects the list of values \ncurated by LOINC that are most often  used in cl inical reporting ( https://loinc.org/usage/units /).  This list likely includes more values than a \npa\nrtner would have in their source system, but we are providing a more comprehensive list to err on the side of completeness. \nWhen mapping from source data to the UCUM values, partners should choose the code that is the  closest match to their source data.   It is  \ne\nxpected that most units  will have a 1:1 match with the UCUM list, though in some cases, there will be  different spelling variations or  \nrepresentations that need to be harmonized or made singular (e.g., mapping P  ERCENT to %  or liter (s)  to liter ).  For laboratory test results  \nand clinical observations, partners should ensure that there is no discordance between the selected unit of measure and the corresponding test  \ncode (e.g., choosing % as a unit of measure  when the  LOINC code indicates the result is reported as  mg/dL).  \nIt is possible that a partner may have unit values that are not part of the LOINC- curated list.  This is because the universe of UCUM codes is \ne\nssentially unbounded ( http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html#datyp2apdxatblxmp).  We have standardized on the LOINC- curated list to \na\nllow for testing of model conformance.  Units that fall outside of this value set should be mapped to \u201cOT,\u201d with the source value stored in \nthe appropriate RAW field, even if they are technically \u201cvalid\u201d UCUM codes.   \nPlease note that there are s everal instances where  a single unit code maps to multiple entries (e.g., nmol/mg{prot} maps to both \u201cnanomole  \nof\n \u00bd cystine per milligram of protein\u201d and \u201cnanomole per milligram of protein\u201d).  This is a known issue and reflective of how  the curated  \nlist of  codes were created by  LOINC.  The values  were distinct at one point but collapsed due to field length restrictions.  In addition, there  \nare instances where units differ solely by letter  case (e.g., \u201cA\u201d \u2013 ampere, \u201ca\u201d \u2013 year; \u201cMs\u201d \u2013 megasecond, \u201cms\u201d \u2013 millisecond).  As with all \nvaluesets, w e will retain case sensitivity when making comparisons on this field .    \n11 \u2013 Use of \u201cOT\u201d when mapping \nto expanded value sets As partners map their source data to the expanded value sets, the value of \u201cOT\u201d ( Other ) may be used in cases where a source value is \npresent, but does not match any of the responses in the value set .  Additionally, \u201c OT\u201d may be used in those cases when a data partner has not \ncompletely mapped all of their source data to the CDM value set for a given variable (e.g., UNIT, ROUTE, FACILITY_TYPE, etc.).  In this \ncase, partners can include the code from the Value Set Reference File for those entries that have been mapped and \u201cOT\u201d for the remainder \nuntil they have been assigned a code from the value set . Unmapped values should be specified in the corresponding RAW field. \n12 \u2013 Required vs. Optional fields The fields that are required to be populated for all records in a given table are listed in the \u201cconstraints\u201d section of each table \ndescription.  Any  table and/or field in the CDM may be required for a partner\u2019s participation in a given study or other PCORnet activity.  In \nassessing foundational  data quality, the PCORnet Data Curation query packages may query any CDM table or field (Language replicated \nfrom Section 2.5 \u2013 Implementation Expectations). \n13 \u2013 Storing P ROs or other \nobservations with date- type \nresponses When loading PROs with a date -type response, store the character/st ring version of the date in PRO_ RESPONSE_TEXT field, and the SAS \nDate format (Numeric) of the response in PRO_RESPONSE NUM.   Analytically, the PRO_RESPONSE_NUM value will be used in \nqueries.  The same logic applies for observations with date-type responses that might be stored within OBS_CLIN or OBS_GEN. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 20 of 210     \n  \n        \n   \n \n \n      \n    \n  \n \n   \n \n     \n  \n \n      \n  \n  \n \n \n    \n   \n   \n \n \n  GENERAL Implementation Guidance (spans more than 1 table) \nTopic Guidance \n14 \u2013 Future Dates If the source system assigns all unspecified end dates with a far -off future date instead of null (e.g., year 4700) , these values should be set to \nnull when loading the CDM.  Only do this for true \u201cdummy\u201d dates that should truly be blank/null, and only for dates that are systematically \nassigned at the source. \n15 \u2013 Correspondence between \nLOINC classes and CDM tables The LOINC Class Type variable has 4 values (as of May 2018): 1 = Lab Class, 2 = Clinical Class, 3 = Claims Attachment, 4 = Su rvey.  This \ninformation can be found on search.loinc.org or in the LOINC Core files.  In general, observations with a class type of \u201c1\u201d will be stored in \nLAB_RESULT_CM.  Observations with a class type of \u201c2\u201d will be loaded into OBS_CLIN, and observations with a class type of \u201c4\u201d will \ngenerally be stored in PRO_CM, but not definitively . \n16 \u2013 Immunizations Vaccines captured as part o f an immunization workflow should be stored in the IMMUNIZATION table.  If immunizations are present in \nother data streams (e.g., medication administrations, procedures, etc.), however, they should not be removed from those table s. \n17 \u2013 Lab LOINC mappings If partners discover that laboratory results have been assigned an incorrect LOINC code within their source system(s), they s hould make \nevery effort to have it corrected by the personnel who maintain those mappings.  In the meantime, it is acceptable to assign the proper \nLOINC code before loading those results into the CDM.  \n18 \u2013 Harmonized field lengths Fields with undefined lengths that are present in more than one CDM table must have consistent field lengths in all tables.  This constraint \napplies to the following fields: PATID, ENCOUNTERID, PRESCRIBINGID, PROCEDURESID, and all PROVIDERID fields \n(PROVIDERID, MEDADMIN_PROVIDERID, OBSGEN_PROVIDERID, OBSCLIN_PROVIDERID, RX_PROVIDERID, and VX_PROVIDERID).  \n19 \u2013 Undefined field lengths For character fiel ds with undefined field lengths, sites should use the minimum length needed to store the data in order to save storage space \nand reduce query processing time . Field lengths for non- RAW fields  should not exceed 256 characters unless it is absolutely necess ary. \n20 \u2013 Missing time elements For tables with start / stop times (e.g., MED_ADMIN), if there is an incomplete start or stop time within the source system ( e.g., minutes or \nhours are missing), leave the field blank. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 21 of 210     \n   \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n 5.

This concept is often insurance-based, but other methods of defining enrollment are possible. \u2022  For partners that do not have insurance-based enrollment information for some of their patients, other  \napproaches can be used to identify periods during w  hich comple te medical capture is expected.  \n\u2022  Members  with medical insurance  coverage, with or without drug c  overage, or should be included.  If a patient  \nhas both medical and drug coverage, create the appropria te enrollment records for each.  \n\u2022  A break in insurance coverage of at least one day  or a change in the chart abstraction flag should  generate a new  \nrecord.  \n\u2022  The ENROLLMENT table provides an important  analytic basis for identifying periods during w  hich medical  \ncare should be observed, for calculating person-time, and for inferring the  meaning of unobserved care (i.e., if  \ncare is not observed, it likely did not happen). The most recently available  information should be populated for  \nBIRTH_DATE, SEX, and other characteristics. If  these attributes have been updated in the patient record, please  \nuse the most recent value.  \nENCOUNTER Encounters are interactions \nbetween patients and providers within the context of healthcare delivery. \u2022  Each ENCOUNTERID will generally reflect a unique combination of PATID, ADMIT_DATE, PROVIDERID and ENC_TYPE. \n \n\u2022  Every diagnosis and procedure recorded during the encounter should have  a separate record in the  DIAGNOSIS  \nor PROCEDURES Tables.   \n\u2022  Multiple visits  to the  same  provider on the same  day may be considered one encounter, especially if defined by  \na reimbursement basis; if so, the ENCOU NTER record should be associated with all diagnoses  and procedures  \nthat were  recorded during those visits.  \n\u2022  Visits to  different  providers for different encounter types on the same day, however, such as a physician \nappointment that leads to a hospitalizatio n, would generally correspond to multiple encounters within the  \nENCOUNTER table.   \n\u2022  Rollback or voided transactions and other  adjustments should be processed before populating this table.  \n\u2022  Although \u201cExpired\u201d is represented in both DISCHARGE_DISPOSITION and D ISCHARGE_STATUS, this  \noverlap represents the reality that both fields are captured in hospital data systems but with variation in how each field is populated. \n \n\u2022  Do not include scheduled encounters.   \n\u2022  Partners should ensure that \u201cadministrative\u201d encounters  (e.g., e-mail, phone, documentation-only), are coded to \nthe appropriate encounter type, which is typically  \u201cOA\u201d  for outpatient visits.  \nDIAGNOSIS Diagnosis codes indicate the \nresults of diagnostic processes \u2022  This table should capture all uniquely recorded diagnoses  for all encounters, with the exception of problem list  \nentries.

Do not omit billing data unless it is \nunavailable from the source system or the partner is certain that the diagnoses loaded from the non- billing \nsystem (e.g., the EHR) represents completely the diagnosis data available from the billing system.  Data from these diffe rent streams have different analytical utility so there is a benefit to including both if available. \n\u2022  Diagnoses are often only related to the treatment of the patient during the specific encounter.

Partners should continue to populate VITAL  with the  \nr\nelevant observations.  Vital measures can also be  stored in OBS_CLIN.  \n\u2022  This table includes measurements recorded in both healthcare and non- healthcare settings.  \n\u2022  The VITAL table contains one record per  result/entry. Multiple measurements may exist in source data (for  \ne\nxample, 3 blood pressure readings on the same day); in this case, each  measurement would be  a  separate  \nrecord.  If multiple vitals are collected at th e same  time (e.g., height, weight and blood pressure  recorded at the  \nstart of an encounter), it is permissible to store these values in a single record.

If the RESULT_UNIT  \nf\nield is not populated, it may not be possible to use a result analytically.    \n\u2022  Verifying LOINC mappings  \u2013 At most health systems, laboratory results are typically not associated with a  \nL\nOINC code at the time they  are generated but are assigned  a code after the fact.  In order to verify that the \nLOINC code has been  appropriately assign ed, the  PCORnet Coordinating Center will verify that the metadata  \nassociated with the result, such as SPECIMEN_SOURCE and RESULT_UNIT, are valid options.  Partners  \nshould ensure that these fields are populated.  Do not derive these values  based on metadata associated with  \nthe selected LOINC code.  \n\u2022  Titers  \u2013 titer results that  are returned as ratios (e.g., 1:4) should be stored in the RESULT_QUAL field even if  \nthese ratios are not explicitly  enumerated in the QUAL valueset. Beginning in CDMv6.1, data model  \nconformance checks for  RESULT_QUAL will include the enumerated list and text strings of [X]:[Y]. \nCONDITION A condition represents a \npatient\u2019s diagnosed and self-\nreported health conditions and diseases. The patient\u2019s medical history and current \nstate may both be represented. \u2022  This table includes both healthcare and non- healthcare settings.  \n\u2022  Rollback or voided transactions and other  adjustments should be processed (removed) before populating this  \ntable.  \n\u2022  These records should NOT be duplicated in the DIAGNO SIS table .  \nPRO_CM This table is used to store \nresponses to patient- reported \noutcome measures (PROs) , \nsurveys, and  questionnaires.  \nThis table can be used to store item- level responses as well \nas the overall score for each measure. \u2022  This version of the PRO_CM table is not optimized for representational  efficiency.  Certain values will be  \ndupl\nicated across records, and many fields will be  blank for certain records.  Over time, the structure of this  \ntable is expected to evolve as PCORnet better defines the analytical use of  PROs across the network.  Until then, this table has been defined to support the broadest  range of possible use cases at the expense of representational  efficiency.    \n\u2022  The PRO_CM table can be used to store both individual item- level responses, as well as the overall  score for the \nm\neasure/instrument.  Each item response will be stored in an individual record.  Measure/instrument scores can \nbe stored along with the item-level responses that are associated with that  measure (where available).  See the figure below for an example of how to populate this table. \n\u2022  If partners are populating PRO item responses or measure scores and are unsure of the PRO_ITEM_NAME, \nP\nRO_ITEM_LOINC, PRO_MEASURE_NAME and/or PRO_MEASURE_LOINC, they sh ould populate  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 26 of 210       \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n    \n  \n  \n \n \n Table Domain Description Table Implementation Guidance \nPRO_ITEM_FULLNAME and PRO_MEASURE_FULLNAME instead.  These fields can be  considered \nanalogous to RAW fields. \n\u2022  For the PRO_CM fields with variable field lengths, partners should choose an appropriate field length based on \nt\nhe characteristics of the data are loading into the table. As we use these tables analytically as part of PCORnet \nstudies, we will determine whether it is more efficient to define specific field lengths. \n\u2022  If a patient completes a survey, but skips a question, create a record in the PRO_CM table as you would for ot\nher items in the survey (i.e., include the appropriate date/time fields and other relevant metadata).  Then leave \nPRO_RESPONSE_TEXT and PRO_RESPONSE_NUM blank, as these fields are not required.  Do not create empty records if the patient did not actually see the question. \n\u2022  The PRO_CM table can be used to store the results from questionnaires where the provider or caregiver are p\nroviding their interpretation or assessment of the patient\u2019s status.  Despite the name, it is not restricted solely to \npatient -reported outcomes.  The table is designed to represent survey-type responses.  General observations \nabout patients, however, like pain scores recorded in an inpatient or surgical setting, should be stored in the OBS_CLIN tab le.  See General Guidance #15 for additional details or contact the DRN OC with questions.     \n\u2022  In general, patient-reported social determinants of health (e.g., food instability) would be expected to be found in \nt\nhis table.  However, if partners who are pa rticipating in initiatives like the National COVID Cohort \nCollaborative have already loaded those records into OBS_GEN, it is acceptable for them to remain there. \n\u2022  For responses that can be represented as either a number or a text (e.g., a numeric value of  2 corresponds to \n\u201crarely\u201d in a value set), the expectation is to store whatever is recorded in the source system. Both should be \npopulated if present, but partners are not expected to derive the other if not. If values are represented based on a \nsequence number, store the actual value, not the sequence number.  \nPRESCRIBING Provider orders for \nmedication dispensing and/or \nadministration. These orders may take place in any setting, including the inpatient or outpatient basis. \u2022  If a medication cannot be mapped to RxNorm, it should still be present and RAW_RX_MED_NAME should be  \npopul\nated.  \n\u2022  This table can be used to store all medication orders, regardless of encounter type  (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, \nE\nD) and can include orders for medications that are to be dispensed as  well as for those that are to be  \nadministered.  \n\u2022  If including orders derived through natural language processing (NLP), make sure that RX_SOURCE has been popul\nated for all records.  \n\u2022  See Reference Table 4  for the ordering strategy for RxNorm Term  Types.  \n\u2022  Do not populate CDM fields with information derived from the RXCUI (e.g., RX_DOSE_ORDERED, R\nX_DOSE_FORM).  Populate fields only if data are captured in the source system  as a discrete value.  \n\u2022  Populate records  with the RXCUI  as it existed at the time  the order  was entered, even if the RXCUI  is no longer  \na\nctive.  Do not attempt to update inactive RXCUIs with a more recent value.  \n\u2022  Medications with approved formulations should have an RXCUI that can adequately represent  all ingredients  \nwith a single code ( e.g., SBD, SCD, MIN).  For  medication mixtures that lack RXCUIs that can  represent all of  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 27 of 210       \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n Table Domain Description Table Implementation Guidance \nthe component ingredients (e.g., IV mixtures prepared at an inpatient or compounding pharmacy), each \nindividual medication from the order set should be included as a  separate record with a unique PRESCRIBINGID.  If partners wish to preserve the fact that the  records belong to the same order, they do so by  creating and populating a   new  optional ORDERID field.  Medications with a 1:1 correspondence between the  order and RXCUI could have the PRESCRIBINGID stored in the ORDERID.  Orders  with a 1:many RXCUI  relationship would have  different PRESCRIBINGIDs but the same ORDERID.  Future versions of  the CDM  may formalize this guidance. \nPCORNET_TRIAL Patients who are enrolled in \nPCORnet clinical trials and PCORnet studies. \u2022  Partners may use the PCORNET_TRIAL table to maintain mappings between PCORnet CDM PATIDs  and \ne\nxternal trial or study  IDs.  \n\u2022  Partners w ishing to use this table will need to register their TRIALID with the DRN OC.  Please contact the  \nD\nRN OC if  you plan to utilize this table.  \n\u2022  TRIALIDs that start with \u201cPT_\u201d and \u201cPS_\u201d are reserved for PCORnet Trials and PCORnet Studies.   Partners  \ns\nhould refra in  from using TRIALIDs that start with these  characters.  The TRIALID \u201cADPT\u201d is also  reserved.  \n\u2022  One patient participating  in multiple trials or studies will have multiple records  \n\u2022  Each PCORnet trial or study will define its parameters  for study or trial parti cipation, and will provide study-\ns\npecific instructions on how to populate the fields  in this table. \n\u2022  Patients who decline to participate in a trial or study or do not meet eligibility criteria should  not be  included in \nth\nis table  \n\u2022  Patients who enroll in a trial or study but later withdraw  should be included in this table, with a date in the  \nT\nRIAL_WITHDRAW_DATE  field. so that their  withdrawal status and date are  recognized and used to \nappropriately manage reporting of CDM data back t o the coordinating c  enter  \n\u2022  In most cases, trials will be expected to have  a trial database that is separate from the CDM  \n\u2022  Randomization assignment is not included in this table due to the potential for unblinding.  \n\u2022  PATID is not  generally appropriate for use  as  a PARTICIPANTID because it is not disambiguated  across  \nne\ntworks.  \nDEATH Reported mortality \ninformation for patients. \u2022  One patient may potentially have multiple records  in this table because their death may be reported by  different  \ns\nources.  \n\u2022  Deaths  represented in the ENCOUNTER.DISCHARGE_DISPOSITION and  \nE\nNCOUNTER.DISCHARGE_STATUS would generally be expected to be present in this table (see  field- level  \nguidance for DEATH.DEATH_SOURCE). \nDEATH_CAUSE The individual causes \nassociated with a reported \ndeath . \u2022  When legacy data have conflicting reports, please make a local determination as to which to use. There is  \ntypically a 1 -2  year lag in death registry data.  \nMED_ADMIN Records of medications \nadministered to patients by \nhealthcare providers.  These \u2022  If a medication cannot be mapped to RxNorm or NDC, it should still be present and RAW_MEDADMIN_NAME should be populated. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 28 of 210       \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Table Domain Description Table Implementation Guidance \nadministrations may take  \nplace in any setting, including\ninpatient, outpatient or home  \nhealth encounters.  \u2022  Only include  administrations that were  actually delivered to the patient, if that level of specificity is available in  \nt\nhe source system.  \n\u2022  Patient -reported medication administrations are not within the scope of this table. \n\u2022  See Reference Table 4  for the ordering strategy for RxNorm Term Types.    \n\u2022  Do not populate CDM fields with information derived from the RXCUI (e.g., MEDADMIN_DOSE_ADMIN).  P\nopulate fields only if data are captured in the source system as  a discrete value.  \n\u2022  Populate records  with the RXCUI  as it existed at the time the order  was entered, even if the RXCUI  is no longer  \na\nctive.  Do not attempt to update inactive RXCUIs with a more recent value.  \n\u2022  If a medication mixture contains multiple RXCUIs (e.g., inpatient mixture), each individual medication from the  \nor\nder set should be included as an individual record with a unique MEDADMINID.  Each individual medication \nis expected to have a unique dose.  \n\u2022  ENCOUNTERID is expected to be present for records in the MED_ADMIN table.  \n\u2022  For administrations where the amount ordered is listed as a rate (e.g., infusions), if the DOSE/DOSE_UNIT  \nv\nalues are specified as a rate, and those fields are stored discretely in  your  EHR, populate the relevant CDM  \nfields.  Assuming that START_DATE/START_TIME and STOP_DATE/STOP_TIME  are  also populated, it  \nwill be possible  to compute the rate analytically.   Otherwise, leave blank.     \nPROVIDER Data about the providers who \nare involved in the care processes documented in the \nCDM. \u2022  Include one  record per provider.   \n\u2022  When populating provider specialty, if multiple values are  available, use the specialty believed to be primary.  \nOBS_CLIN Standardized qualitative and \nquantitative clinical observations about a patient, including vital signs.  Some observations may also be represented in the VITAL table. \u2022  The OBS_CLIN table is intended to store standardized clinical observations that have been recorded about a  \npa\ntient.   \n\u2022  Examples of the types of  observations that can be  stored in this table include pulmonary function test results  \n(\ne.g., FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC), echocardiogram results  (e.g., left ventricle ejection fraction)  and vital signs  \n(e.g., temperature) .  \n\u2022  Vital signs that can be stored in the VITAL table  may  also be stored in this table (e.g., systolic blood pressure), \nt\nhough VITAL should continue to be populated. The DRNOC maintains a list of  LOINC  codes that  can be used \nto represent these observations.  T he Value Set Appendix contains a list of codes that can be used to map records  \nthat were previously stored in the VITAL table.  For completeness purposes, it contains both preferred and discouraged codes.  Partners should select the  code(s) that best represent the data in their source systems but  \nshould not utilize a code  that encodes more information than is available in their data (e.g., do not use a code  \nthat specifies a method if the method is unknown).  In general, discouraged codes should not be used. \n\u2022  Decisions on what to include in this table and how to prioritize the population of those records are expected to \nbe\n driven primarily by potential funding opportunities.  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 29 of 210       \n\u2022 \t This table provides a  generalized structure  for storing observations and is not optimi zed for analytical efficiency.   \nA\ns elements from this table are used in studies and/or distributed queries, additional representations  of those  \ndata elements (i.e., new table structures) may be required to better support those activities.  \n\u2022\t  If partners are p opulating pain scores (not pain-related PRO surveys) captured in an inpatient or surgical setting, \nt\nhese values would be  expected to be present in this table, not PRO_CM.   \n\u2022 \t If an observation has a value set that includes an option of \u201cnot documented or ass essed\u201d (or similar), these \nva\nlues should be included in the CDM if they are  present in the source system.  Do not derive if  an observation \nis missing.    \n\u2022  If a partner has access to  vital signs that are sourced from a device feed, they  should make an assessm ent about  \nd\nata volume before including these measures, particularly if multiple readings per day are present for a large \npercentage of their population.  Measures should not be averaged or  aggregated.  \n\u2022  For healthcare device data sources:  If multiple readings are available and the volume of data is judged by the \nda\nta partner to be too burdensome for inclusion, using the set of values that were  recorded directly in the  \nmedical record is preferred over any  algorithmic selection process.   \n\u2022  For personal device da ta sources:  If multiple readings are available and the volume of data is judged  by the data \npa\nrtner to be too high for inclusion, the project/study leadership should define a method for selecting individual  \nmeasurements and this logic should be documented in the ETL ADD.  \n\u2022  Observations recorded  together (e.g., diastolic and systolic blood pressure) should have  the same date(s) and time(s).  \n       \n  \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n     \n  \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n    Table Domain Description Table Implementation Guidance \nOBS_GEN Table to store everything else. \u2022\t Partners may use this table to store network -or study -specific data elements. \n\u2022\t Records in this table are not expected to be used in queries distributed by the DRN OC.   \n\u2022\t This table provides a generalized structure for storing observations and is not optimized for analytical efficiency.  \nAs elements from this table are used in studies  and/or distributed queries, additional representations of those \ndata elements (i.e., new table structures) may be required to better support those activities. \nHASH_TOKEN Encrypted hash tokens that \nare used to match patient \nrecords across DataMarts using privacy-preserving record linkage methods. \u2022\t Every patient in the DEMOGRAPHIC table is expected to have one record in the HASH_TOKEN table  for each  \nTOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY.  \n\u2022\t Tokens are generated from personally- identifiable information (PII).  This information can be stored in each \npa\nrtner\u2019s PRIVATE_DEMOGRAPHIC table and PRIVATE_ADDRESS_HISTORY table.  The PII is used as \ninput to the Datavant DeId/tokenization module.  Tokens should not be placed into the CDM until they have \nbeen transformed into Site-PCORnet transit tokens using the Datavant Link/transform-tokens module. \n\u2022\t If PII fields are populated with dummy values by default (e.g., 999-99-9999 for phone number or SSN), these \nva\nlues should be removed before running the Datavant DeID/tokenization module.  If PII is not available within \nthe source system or if local restrictions prevent its use, leave the input field blank. \n\u2022\t Tokens are generated based on data availability. If input data is not present for a given token strategy (e.g., \ncombination of PII elements), no token will be generated and an error code will be produced instead.

Do not enforce a 44- character constraint, \nhow\never, to accommodate the error codes generated in the case of tokenization failure. \n\u2022  Tokens should be generated as part of every refresh.  P artners can choose to generate tokens for all patients, or \nonl\ny for those patients who were added between refreshes or had updates to their PII. \n\u2022  Select tokens generated using the Datavant DeID/ tokenization module are certified as de -identified data via the \nH\nIPAA Expert Determination method in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR parts 160 and 164). \nAll tokens in the HASH_TOKEN table satisfy this criteria and are controlled via the Datavant DeID PCORnet \nconfiguration settings within the Datavant software. \n\u2022  Additional token strategies are available and can be implemented as needed on a per-study basis based on the s\ntudy- specific data dictionary. \n\u2022  See the Supplemental Guide on Privacy- Preserving Record Linkage for additional implementation details and \ng\nuidance (separate document). \n\u2022  Partners that wish to include tokens encrypted using multiple keys for internal purposes should add a T\nOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY field and store the key name there.  When responding to PCORnet queries/data \ncuration, the table should be filtered to only include tokens used in PCORnet linkages. The name of this key should also be included in the TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY field in HARVEST.  \n\u2022  Partners should include the TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY string that is output from the Datavant Link \ns\noftware.  Please ensure that this table includes tokens encrypted using the PCORnet key (includes \u201cpcornet\u201d or \nsimilar in the output string).   If partners are encrypting their tokens using multiple keys, it is acceptable to \ninclude those additional records in this table.  \nLDS_ADDRESS_HISTORY Longitudinal record of a \npatient\u2019s address that adheres to the requirements of a Limited Data Set. \u2022  Expect multiple records per individual  \n\u2022  This table is currently limited to addresses in the  United States.  \n\u2022  Partners can limit records in this table to validated addresses if known.  \n\u2022  If partners have difficulty  constructing a   longitudinal address history for patients within their DataMart, they  \ns\nhould prioritize populating the  current address  for each patient.  \nIMMUNIZATION Records of immunizations \nthat have been delivered within the health system as well as reports of those \nadministered elsewhere. \u2022  Do not include study vaccines.  \nHARVEST Attributes associated with the \nspecific PCORnet datamart \u2022  If partners need to impute date values, whether for a portion of the date (e.g., month) or the  entire string, a value  \nof\n \u201c02\u201d should be  chosen for the relevant DATE_MGMT field(s).  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 31 of 210       \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n    \n  \n  Table Domain Description Table Implementation Guidance \nimplementation, including  \ndata refreshes.  \u2022  If partners must impute the entire date for  a field, this should only be done  for those dates that  are  required.  \nO\nptional fields should be left blank in these situations. \n\u2022  All date obfuscation and imputation strategies must be thoroughly documented in the Extract, Transform and \nL\noad (ETL) Annotated Data Dictionary (ADD) . \n\u2022  Partners should refrain from obfuscating dates within the CDM, with the possible exception of BIRTH_DATE \n(see General Guidance #2).

It is designed to store details  related to units of measure and \nnormal ranges  for laboratory  results that do not include such values at the record level.

Table: ENROLLMENT  \nENROLLMENT Domain Description:  \nEnrollment is a concept that defines a period of time  during  \nwh\nich a person is expected to have complete data capture. This \nconcept is often insurance -based, but  other methods of defining  \nenrollment are possible.  \nRelational Integrity: \nThe ENROLLMENT table contains one record per unique combination of PATID, ENR_START_DATE, and ENR_BASIS.  \nPlease note: Each form of coverage (the ENR_BASIS) would have a separate record; for example, if a patient has both medical coverage and drug coverage, these would be 2 separate records, \npot\nentially with different enrollment dates for each record. \nComposite Primary Key: PATID, ENR_START_DATE, ENR_BASIS \nForeign Key: ENROLLMENT.PATID is a foreign key to DEMOGRAPHIC.PATID (many -to-one relationship) \nConstraints: \nPATID + ENR_START_DATE + ENR_BASIS (unique)  PATID  (required, not null)   \nENR_START_DATE (required, not null)  ENR_BASIS (required, not  null)   \nENROLLMENT Table Implementation Guidance \nGuidance \n\u2022  For partners that do not have insurance -based enrollment information for some of their patients, other approaches can be used to identify periods during which comple te medical capture is expected. \n\u2022  Members with medical insurance coverage, with or without drug coverage, or should be included.  If a patient has both medical and drug coverage, create the appropriate enrollment records for each. \n\u2022  A break in insurance coverage of at least one day or a change in the chart abstraction flag should generate a new record. \n\u2022  The ENROLLMENT table provides an important analytic basis for identifying periods during which medical care should be observed, for calculating person-time, and for inferring the meaning of \nunobs\nerved care (i.e., if care is not observed, it likely did not happen). The most recently available information should be populated for BIRTH_DATE, SEX, and other characteristics.

If partners have access to multiple versions of each diagnosis within a given \nencounter (e.g., admitting, interim, final), the preference is to prioritize final or discharge diagnoses.  A value shoul d be specified in DX_SOURCE to indicate the classification of the diagnosis.   \n\u2022Diagnoses from problem lists will be captured in the CONDITION table. \n\u2022 If a patient has multiple diagnoses associated with one encounter, then there would be one record in this t able for each diagnosis. \n\u2022ENCOUNTERID should be populated for DIAGNOSIS and PROCEDURES. The definitions of the DIAGNOSIS and PROCEDURES tables are depe ndent upon a healthcare context; therefore, the \nencounter basis is necessary and the ENCOUNTERID, PROVIDER ID, ENCOUNTER_TYPE, and ADMIT_DATE from the associated ENCOUNTER record should be included.   While not \ndesirable, a low percentage of orphan records is permissible to accommodate instances in which the associated ENCOUNTER details are missing from the sou rce data. \n\u2022  Data in this table are expected to be from healthcare-mediated processes and reimbursement drivers, including technical/facility billing, professional billing and other data strea ms. Do not omit billing \ndata unless it is unavailable from the source system or the partner is certain that the diagnoses loaded from the non- billing system (e.g., the EHR) represents completely the diagnosis data available \nfrom the billing system. Data from these different streams have different analytical utility so there is a benefit to including both if available. \n\u2022  Diagnoses are often only related to the treatment  of the patient during the specific encounter. Chronic conditions that are not be pertinent to the treatment of a specific encounter, for example, would \nnot be expected to be present. \n\u2022If a local vocabulary is used, but canno t be mapped to a standard vocabulary such as ICD -9-CM, DX_TYPE should be populated as \u201cOther\u201d and the local value stored in DX.  If the local value can be \nmapped to a standard vocabulary, follow the guidance around the population of Raw fields (General Guidance #1). \n\u2022  Partners should continue to populate ADMIT_DATE, even if they are populating DX_DATE.  Analyses may leverage either date, or both.  DX_DATE can be particularly useful for i dentifying \ndiagnoses or conditions that might have developed over the course of a long inpatient encounter.    \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 55 of 210      \n \n   \n \n    \n  \n \n     \n   \n     \n        \n  \n \n     \n \n   \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n  \n  DIAGNOSIS Table Specification \nField Name RDBMS Data \nType SAS Data Type Predefined Value Sets and \nDescriptive Text for Categorical \nFields Definition / Comments Data Element \nProvenance Field -level Implementation \nGuidance \nDIAGNOSISID RDBMS Text(x) SAS Char(x) .

Partners should continue to populate VITAL with the relevant observations . Vital measures can also be stored in OBS_CLIN. \n\u2022 This table includes measurements recorded in both healthcare and non- healthca re settings. \n\u2022  The VITAL table contains one record per result/entry. Multiple measurements may exist in source data (for example, 3 blood pressure readings on the same day); in this case, each measurement would \nbe a separ\nate record. If multiple vitals are collected at the same time (e.g., height, weight and blood pressure recorded at the start of an encounter), it is permissible to store these values in a single \nrecord. This table should be populated with all available measures, with the possible exception(s) noted below. \n\u2022  If a partner has access to vital signs that are sourced from a device feed, they should make an assessment about data volume before including these measures, particularly if multiple readings per day are present for a large percentage of their population.  Measures should not be averaged or aggregated. \no For healthcare device data sources: If multiple readings are available and the volume of data is judged by the data partner t o be too bur\n densome for inclusion, using the set of values that were \nrecorded dire ctly in the medical record is preferred over any algorithmic selection process. \n\u2022  For per\nsonal device data sources: If multiple readings are available and the volume of data is judged by the data partner to be too high for inclusion, the project/study leade rship should define a method \nfor selecting individual measurements. in the ETL ADD . \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 69 of 210     \n \n \n \n    \n \n    \n  \n \n      \n   \n     \n     \n \n      \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     Figure 1.

If the result suggests that the test was run (e.g., result is \"borderlin e\" or \"inconclusive\") include it. But if the test is not resulted for \nany reason (specimen not sufficient, patient did not show), t hen do not include it. \n\u2022If lab results are stored using local or custom codes, partners should ensure that the assigned LOINC code has been validated by a subject matter expert or similar process \n\u2022  If a LOINC code is available for a given result, the LAB_LOINC field should be populated.  If a LOINC code is available for t he o rder, that value can be used to populate the LAB_PX field.  Note \nthat one order can correspond to many different results.  Each result should have its own record in the LAB_RESULT_CM table.  If the same LOINC code is used to populate both the order and the \nresult, partners should ensure that the LAB_LOINC field is populated.  \n\u2022  Inclusion of additional lab results -Partners should include all available laboratory results within their LAB_RESULT_CM table.  If the result has a validated LOINC code, the LAB_LOINC field \nshoul\nd be populated.  Otherwise, the LAB_LOINC field should be blank.  The RAW_LAB_NAME field can be used to keep track of the various lab results until the appropriate LOINC code is \nassigned. Lab results beyond the 11 originally included in the PCORnet CDM are being requested in order to establish a denominator of potentially available lab results.  Over time, the numb er of \nunmapped results is expected to decrease.   Results for labs performed as a service for outside institutions do not need to be included.  Results from external vendors (e.g., LabCorp, Quest) should be \nincluded when available. \n\u2022  Clinical LOINC Concepts \u2013 Only include Laboratory LOINC concepts in this table.  Do not include clinical LOINC concepts (e.g., EKG results).  These records may be stored in the OBS_CLIN \ntab\nle. \n\u2022  Standing orders - Partners should populate the date fields to the best of their ability.  For results that are tied to standing laboratory orders, even if LAB_ORDER_DATE reflects the date of the \nori\nginal standing order, SPECIMEN_DATE and/or RESULT_DATE would be expected to correspond to the time when the sample was collected/resulted.  Analys es will take both dates into \nconsideration.  \n\u2022  Units of measure \u2013 A given LOINC code may have many acceptable units of measure.  If the RESULT_UNIT field is not populated, it may not be possi ble to use a result analytically. \n\u2022  Verifying LOINC mappings \u2013 At most health systems, laboratory results are typically not associated with a LOINC code at the time they are generated but are assigned a code after the fact. In order \nto v\nerify that the LOINC code has been appropriately assigned, the PCORnet Coordinat ing Center will verify that the metadata associated with the result, such as SPECIMEN_SOURCE and \nRESULT_UNIT, are valid options.  Partners should ensure that these fields are populated.  Do not derive these values based on metadata associated with the selected LOINC code. \n\u2022 Titers \u2013 titer results that are returned as ratios (e.g., 1:4) should be stored in the RESULT_QUAL field even if these ratios are not explicitly enumerated in the QUAL valueset. Beginning in CDM v6.1, \ndat\na model conformance checks for RESUL T_QUAL will include the enumerated list and text strings of [X]:[Y] as acceptable values.  \nLAB_RESULT_CM Table Specification \nField Name RDBMS Data Type SAS Data Type Predefined Value Sets and \nDescriptive Text for Categorical \nFields Definition / Comments Data Element \nProvenance Field -level Implementation \nGuidance \nLAB_RESULT_CM_ID RDBMS Text(x) SAS Char(x) .

Table: PRO_CM \nPRO_CM Domain Description:   \nThis ta\nble is used to store responses to patient-reported outcome \nmeasures (PROs ), surveys, and questionnaires.  This table can be \nused to store item -level responses as well as the overall score for \neach measure. \n(Domain description updated in v4.0) \nRelational Integrity: \nThe PRO_ CM table contains one record per PRO_CM_ID. \nPrimary Key: PRO_CM_ID \nForeign Keys: PRO_CM.PATID is a foreign key to DEMOGRAPHIC.PATID (many -to-one relationship)\n \nPRO_CM.ENCOUNTERID is a  f\n oreign key to ENCOUNTER.ENCOUNTERID (zero /many -to-one relationship)\n  \n Co\nnstraints :\n  \nPRO_CM_ID (unique; required, not null)\n PATID  (\nrequired, not null)  \n \nPRO_DATE (required, not null)\n \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 98 of 210      \n \n         \n      \n     \n      \n        \n     \n   \n      \n \n         \n       \n     \n      \n   \n       \n  \n           \n        \n PRO_CM Table Implementation Guidance \nGuidance \n\u2022 This version of the PRO_CM table is not optimized for representational efficiency.  Certain values will be duplicated across records, and ma ny fields will be blank for certain records.  Over time, the \nstructure of this table is expected to evolve as PCORnet better defines the analytical use of PROs across the network.  Until then, this table has been defined to support the broadest range of possible \nuse cases at the expense of representational efficiency. \n\u2022  The PRO_CM table can be used to store both individual item- level responses, as well as the overall score for the measure/instrument.  Each item response will be stored in an individual record .  \nMeas\nure/instrument scores can be stored along with the item -level responses that are associated with that measure (where available).  See the figure below for an example of how to populate th is table. \n\u2022 If partners are populating PRO item responses or measure scores and are unsure of the PRO_ITEM_NAME, PRO_ITEM_LOINC, PRO_MEASURE_NAME and/or PRO_MEASURE_LOINC, they \ns\nhould populate PRO_ITEM_FULLNAME and PRO_MEASURE_FULLNAME instead. These fields can be considered analogous to RAW fields. \n\u2022 For the PRO_CM fields with variable field lengths, p artners should choose an appropriate field length based on the characteristics of the data are loading into the table. As we use these tables \nan\nalytically as part of PCORnet studies, we will determine whether it is more efficient to define specific field l engths. \n\u2022 If a patient completes a survey, but skips a question, create a record in the PRO_CM table as you would for other items in th e survey (i.e., include the appropriate date/time fields and other relevant \nm\netadata). Then leave PRO_RESPONSE_TEXT and PR O_RESPONSE_NUM blank, as these fields are not required.  Do not create empty records if the patient did not actually see the question. \n\u2022  The PRO_CM table can be used to store the results from questionnaires where the provider or caregiver are providing their interpretation or assessment of the patient\u2019s status.  Despite the name, it is \nn\not restricted solely to patient- reported outcomes. The table is designed to represent survey -type responses. General observations about patients, however, like pain scores r ecorded in an inpatient or \nsurgical setting, should be stored in the OBS_CLIN table.  See General Guidance #15 for additional details or contact the DRN OC with questions.    \n\u2022 In general, patient-reported social determinants of health (e.g., food instability) would be expected to be found in this table.  However, if partners who are participating in initiatives like the National \nC\nOVID Cohort Collaborative have already loaded those records into OBS_GEN, it is acceptable for them to remain there. \n\u2022  For responses that can be represented as either a number or a text (e.g., a numeric value of 2 corresponds to \u201crarely\u201d in a v alue set), the expectation is to store whatever is recorded in the source system. \nBoth should be populated if present, but partners are not expected to derive the other if not.  If values are represented based on a sequence number, store the actual value, not the sequence number. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 99 of 210 Note: Not all fields are shown \nNote: Scores not correctly calculated \nPRO_CM_ID PATIO ENCOUNTERID PRO_TYPE ,PRO_ITEM_NAME PRO_ITEM _ \nLOINC PRO_RESPONSE \n_TEXT PRO_RESPONSE\nNUM _ \nPRO_MEASURE_NAME PRO_MEASUR E \n_SEQ PRO_MEASURE \n_SCORE PRO_MEASURE \n_THETA PRO_MEASURE _ \nSCALED_TSCORE PRO_MEASURE _ \nSTANDARD_ERR \nOR PRO_MEASURE_ \nCOUNT_SCORED PRO_MEASUR E \n_LOINC PRO_MEASURE \n_VERSION PRO_ITEM_FULLNAME PRO_ITEM_TEXT PRO_MEASURE_FULLNAME \nExample -PROM IS measure with individual item responses (as text and numeric), as well as the overall measure score (repeated for each field) \n0001 001 100000 PM SleeplOS 61996-5 Very much 5 PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, my sleep was restless \n0002 001 100000 PM Sleep115 619S5-S Not at all \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, I was satisified with my sleep \n0003 001 100000 PM Sleep116 619S6-6 Very much \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, my sleep was refreshing \n0004 001 100000 PM Sleep44 61999-9 Not at all \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, I had difficulty falling asleep \n0005 001 100000 PM Sleep87 61992-4 Never \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, I had trouble staying asleep \n0006 001 100000 PM Sleep90 61993-2 Never \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7days, I had trouble sleeping \n0007 001 100000 PM SleepllO 61988-2 Always \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, I got enough sleep \n0008 001 100000 PM Sleep109 61987-4 Very poor \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, my sleep quality was \nExample -PROM IS measure with a score, but no individual item responses \n0009 001 100010 PM PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 17 O.Sl 5S.1 2.9 \n 1.0 I Example -\"operational\" PRO (PHQ9) that has a score, but no item responses \n0010 001 100001 LC PHQ9 \n 44261-6 I Example -\"operational\" PRO (disability survey) that has individual responses (text and numeric) that are not combined into a summary score Patient Health Questionna ire 9 item \n0012 002 200000 LC 69854-8 Ethnicity \n 11111 69919-9 Are you Hispanic, Latino/a, or of Spanish \norigin?

Populate fields on ly if data are captured in the source system as a discrete \nv\nalue. \n\u2022 Populate records with the RXCUI as it existed at the time the order was entered, even if the RXCUI is no longer active.  Do not attempt to update inactive RXCUIs with a more recent value. \n\u2022 Medications with approved formulations should have an RXCUI that can adequately represent all ingredients with a single code (e.g., SBD, SCD, MIN). For medication mixtures that lack RXCUIs that \nc\nan represent all of the component ingredients (e.g., IV mixtures prepared at an inpatient or compounding pharmacy), each individual medication from the order set should be included as a separate record \nwith a unique PRESCRIBINGID.  If partners wish to preserve the fact that the records belong to the same order, they do so by creating and populating a new optional  ORDERID field.  Medications with a \n1:1 correspondence between the order and RXCUI could have the PRESCRIBINGID stored in the ORDERID.  Orders with a 1:many RXCUI relationship would have different PRESCRIBINGIDs but the \nsame ORDERID. Future versions of the CDM may formalize this guidance. \nPRESCRIBING Table Specification \nField Name RDBMS Data \nType SAS Data Type Predefined Value Sets and \nDescriptive Text for \nCategorical Fields Definition / Comments Data Element \nProvenance Field -level Implementation \nGuidance \nPRESCRIBINGID RDBMS \nText(x) SAS Char(x) .

The DRNOC maintains a list of LOINC \nc\nodes that can be used to represent these observations . The Value Set Appendix contains a list of codes that can be used to map records that were previously stored in the VITAL tabl e.  For \ncompleteness purposes, it contains both preferred and discouraged codes.  Partners should select the code(s) that best represent the data in the ir source systems but should not utilize a code that encodes \nmore information than is available in their data (e.g., do not use a code that specifies a method if the method is unknown).  In general, discouraged codes should not be used. \n\u2022 Decisions on what to include in this table and how to prioritize the population of those records are expected to be driven pr imarily by potential fund ing opportunities. \n\u2022  This table provides a generalized structure for storing observations and is not optimized for analytical efficiency.  As elements from this table are used in studies and /or distributed queries, additional \nr\nepresentations of those data elements (i.e., new table structures) may be required to better support those activities. \n\u2022  If partners are populating pain scores (not pain- related PRO surveys) captured in an inpatient or surgical setting, these values would be expected to be present in this table, not PRO_CM.  \n\u2022  If an observation has a value set that includes an option of \u201cnot documented or assessed\u201d (or similar), these values should be included in the CDM if they are present in the source system.  Do n ot \nde\nrive if an observation is missing. \n\u2022 If a partner has access to vital signs that are sourced from a device feed, they should make an assessment about data volume before including these measures, particularly if multiple readings per day \nar\ne present fo r a large percentage of their population.  Measures should not be averaged or aggregated.  \n\u2022  For healthcare device data sources: If multiple readings are available and the volume of data is judged by the data partner t o be too burdensome for inclusion, using the set of values that were recorded \nd\nirectly in the medical record is preferred over any algorithmic selection process. \n\u2022  For personal device data sources: If multiple readings are available and the volume of data is judged by the data partner to be too h igh for inclusion, the project/study leadership should define a method \nf\nor selecting individual measurements and this logic should be documented in the ETL ADD. \n\u2022  Observations recorded together (e.g., diastolic and systolic blood pressure) should have the sa me date(s) and time(s). \nOBS_CLIN Table Specification \nField Name RDBMS Data \nType SAS Data Type Predefined Value Sets and \nDescriptive Text for Categorical \nFields Definition / Comments Data Element \nProvenance Field -level Implementation \nGuidance \nOBSCLIN ID RDBMS Text(x) SAS Char(x) .

This information can be stored in each partner\u2019s PRIVATE_DEMOGRAPHIC table and PRIVATE_ADDRESS_HISTORY table .  \nT\nhe PII is used as input to the Datavant DeId/tokenization  module.  Tokens should not be placed into the CDM until they have been transformed into Site -PCORnet  transit tokens using the Datavant \nLink /transform-tokens module. \n\u2022  If PII fields are populated with dummy values by default (e.g., 999-99-9999 for phone number or SSN), these values should be removed before running the Datavant DeID/tokenization module.  If PII is \nn\not available within the source system or if local restrictions prevent its use, leave the input field blank . \n\u2022  Tokens are generated based on data availability. If input data is not present for a given token strategy (e.g., combination of PII elements), no token will be generated and an error code will be produced \ni\nnstead.  These token error codes should be loaded into the HASH_TOKEN table (i.e., there should not be any null values).  Do not suppress the error codes in the output of the Datavant software. \n\u2022  Each successfully generated token has a fixed length of 44 characters. Do not enforce a 44 -character constraint, however, to accommodate the error codes generated in the case of tokenization failure. \n\u2022  Tokens should be generated as part of every refresh. Partners can choose to generate tokens for all patients, or only for those patients who were added between refreshes or had updates to their PII . \n\u2022 Select tokens generated using the Datavant DeID /tokenization module are certified as de-identified data via the HIPAA Expert Determination method in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR \npa\nrts 160 and 164). All tokens in the HASH_TOKEN table satisfy this criteria and are controlled via the Datavant DeID  PCORnet configuration settings within the Datavant software . \n\u2022 Additional token strategies are available and can be implemented as needed on a per -study basis based on the study -specific data dictionary . \n\u2022  See the Supplemental Guide on Privacy -Preserving Record Linkage for additional implementation details and guidance (separate document). \n\u2022 Partners that wish to include tokens encrypted using multiple keys for internal purposes should add a TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_ KEY field and store the key name there.  When responding to PCORnet \nque\nries/data curation, the table should be filtered to only include tokens used in PCORnet linkages. The name of this key should also be included in the TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY field in HARVE ST. \n\u2022  Partners should include the TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY string that is output from the Datavant Link software.  Please ensure that this table includes tokens encrypted using the PCORnet key (includes \n\u201cpcornet\u201d or similar in the output string).

Table: LAB_HISTORY \nLAB_HISTORY  Domain Description:   \nTable for  storing historical information about units of measure and \nreference ranges for  laboratory test results.  \nRelational Integrity: \nThe LAB_HISTORY table contains one record per LABHISTORYID. \nPrimary Key: LABHISTORYID \nConstraints: \nLABHISTORYID (unique; required, not null) LAB_LOINC  (required, not null)  \nLAB_HISTORY  Table  Implementation Guidance   \nGuidance  \n\u2022  This  table is  intended to serve as a resource for  partners as they de velop their  extract -transform -load (ETL) procedures to populate LAB_RESULT_CM.  It is designed to  store details related to  units of  \nm\neasure and  normal ranges for  laboratory results that do not  include  such  values at the  record level.   Partners can  use this table as a reference during their ETL  to look up and populate the  relevant  fields  in \nLAB_RESULT_CM for those  records.    \n\u2022  It is expected  t hat partners will  be able to  find information  on units of measure and normal range via reference material maintained by their  clinical labs (electronic documents or online catalogs).   It is not \nnecessary to derive this metadata from individual lab results.  DO NOT DERIVE THESE DATA FROM LOINC RESOURCES.  \n\u2022  While values for  t his table may need to be entered manually, a relatively small n umber of tests (~150)  typically cover the vast majority of testing volume (>85%), which should minimize any data  entry  \nburden.  \n\u2022  Partners may not need to populate this table, particularly if they are already able to meet the network lab data quality metr ics.  \n\u2022  Partners do not need  t o create records in  this table for results that come from external  reference labs (e.g., Quest, LabCorp ).  The DRN OC can provide this  information on request.  \n\u2022  The DRN OC may reference this table if  l abs are needed as part of  a particular study or analysis and  the units and/or reference range is missing from the result(s).  Partners may be asked to populate \nrecords in  this table for th ose  corresponding tests.  \n\u2022  Every record in this table  s hould be unique.  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 187 of 210  LABHISTORYID LAB_LOINC LAB_FACILITYID SEX RACE AGE_MIN_WKS AGE_MAX_WKS RESULT_UNIT NORM_RANGE_LOW NORM_MOIOIFIER_LOW NORM_RANGE_HIGH NORM_MODIFIER_HIGH PERIOD_START PERIOD_END RAW_LAB_NAME RAW_UNIT RAW_RANGE \n1 51733-4 1 NS NS 0 4% 85 EQ 97EQ 1/1/15 02 Sat Arterial % 85.00. 97.00 \n2 51733-4 1 NS NS 4 7826% 90 EQ 100 EQ 1/1/15 02 Sat Arterial % 90.00. 100.00\n3 2093-3 2 f NS 0 104.356 mg/dl 44 EQ 181 EQ 1/1/13 12/31/18 Chol mg/dl 44.00-181.00 \n4 2093-3 2 f NS 104.346 7826 mg/dl NO 199 LE 1/1/13 12/31/18 Chol mg/dL <=199.00 \n5 2093-3 2 f NS 0 104.356 mg/dL 40 EQ 186 EQ 1/1/19 Chol mg/dL 40.00-186.00 \n6 2093-3 2 f NS 104.346 7826 mg/dL NO 205 LE 1/1/19 Chol mg/dL <=205.00 I \nFigure 1: Example of populated records for LAB_HISTORY.

It is not necessary to create and populate \nthis table solely for that field. However, partners who are participating in the PCORnet geographic surveillance pilots or those who wish to have their patient populations included in any future geographic \ncharacterizations of PCORnet will need to populate LDS_ADDRESS_HISTORY.  In those situations, there may be a benefit in using PRIVATE_ADDRESS_HISTORY as a local staging table. \n\u2022  Expect multiple records per individual. \n\u2022  This table is currently limited to addresses in the United States. \n\u2022 Partners can limit records in this table to validated addresses if known. \n\u2022  If partners have difficulty constructing a longitudinal address history for patients within their DataMart, they should prioritize populating the current address for each patient. \n\u2022 Geocoded information about the address should be stored in PRIVATE_ADDRESS_GEOCODE. \n\u2022  This tabl e can be kept logically and physically separate from the rest of the CDM.

The website serves as a central hub for information about PCORnet's data resources, quality, security, and privacy measures. It highlights the scale and quality of data accessible through PCORnet, which includes data from over 30 million people annually across the U.S. The data is derived from everyday healthcare encounters and includes electronic health records (EHRs), patient-reported data, and payor data, all standardized into a common format using the PCORnet Common Data Model (CDM). This standardization allows researchers to ask the same question across millions of patients and receive consistent, reliable answers, even from disparate systems. The website provides detailed sections on data sources, data quality, data security, and privacy measures. The data quality section describes a rigorous two-stage screening process to ensure data conformance, completeness, plausibility, and persistence.

CONVENTIONS \n1. Each Person can have more than one valid OBSERVATION_PERIOD record, but no two \nobservation periods can overlap in time for a given person. \n2. During an Observation Period, any clinical event that happens to the patient is expected to be \nrecorded. Conversely, the absence of data indicates that no clinical events occurred to the \npatient. \n3. No clinical data are valid outside an active Observation Period. Clinical data that refer to a time \noutside (diagnoses of previous conditions such as \"Old MI\" or medical history) of an active \nObservation Period are recorded as Observations. The date of the Observation is the first day \nof the first Observation Period of a patient. \n4.

            "summary": "The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) website serves as a comprehensive resource for information on multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. The primary purpose of the site is to accelerate a cure for multiple myeloma by providing resources and support for patients, caregivers, and those interested in getting involved or donating. The website offers a variety of actions such as navigating to the MMRF homepage, signing up for updates or events, donating, searching for information, learning about multiple myeloma, navigating diagnosis and treatment options, finding support resources, accessing the education resource hub, learning about efforts to find a cure, and exploring patient toolkit options. Users can also contact the MMRF for support and view the impact of the foundation's work. The site is structured with several key sections including a header with navigation links and a search bar, a mission statement, a 'Get Involved' section, a 'Navigating Diagnosis & Treatment' section, and an 'Unprecedented Results' section highlighting MMRF's impact. Specific links on the website direct users to pages for signing up for updates, donating, understanding multiple myeloma, navigating diagnosis and treatment, finding support resources, accessing educational resources, learning about efforts to find a cure, getting involved, and learning about the MMRF organization. The website also offers a patient navigation center for support and information on upcoming educational events. The 'Understanding Your Lab Report' section provides detailed information on various lab tests and their significance in diagnosing and monitoring multiple myeloma.

The GENIE platform will integrate and link clinical-grade cancer genomic\ndata with clinical outcome data for tens of thousands of cancer patients treated at multiple\ninternational institutions. The project fulfills an unmet need in oncology by providing the\nstatistical power necessary to improve clinical decision-making, to identify novel therapeutic\ntargets, to understand of patient response to therapy, and to design new biomarker-driven\nclinical trials. The project will also serve as a prototype for aggregating, harmonizing, and\nsharing clinical-grade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data obtained during routine medical\npractice.\nThe data within GENIE is being shared with the global research community. The database\ncurrently contains CLIA-/ISO-certified genomic data obtained during the course of routine\npractice at multiple international institutions (Table 1), and will continue to grow as more\npatients are treated at additional participating centers.\nHuman Subjects Protection and Privacy\nProtection of patient privacy is paramount, and the AACR Project GENIE therefore requires\nthat each participating center share data in a manner consistent with patient consent and\ncenter-specific Institutional Review Board (IRB) policies. The exact approach varies by cen-\nter, but largely falls into one of three categories: IRB-approved patient-consent to sharing of\n4de-identified data, captured at time of molecular testing; IRB waivers and; and IRB approvals\nof GENIE-specific research proposals. Additionally, all data has been de-identified via the\nHIPAA Safe Harbor Method. Full details regarding the HIPAA Safe Harbor Method are\navailable online at: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-\nidentification/.\nData Hamonization & QC Process\nThe GENIE dataset is generated from data curated by multiple cancer centers. Each center\nprepares their data by uploading their files onto the Synapse platform.\nRequired files:\n\u2022 Clinical patient and sample data\n\u2022 Variant data (MAF or VCF file)\n\u2022 Assay information\n\u2022 Genomic regions data (BED file)\nOptional files:\n\u2022 Structural variant data\n\u2022 Segmented data\n\u2022 Discrete copy number data\n\u2022 Mutations in cis data\n\u2022 Sample and/or patient retraction file\nOnly validated files that adhere to the submission guidelines will be pushed to the release. The\nfiles that do not pass these validation checks will not be processed and an email notifying any\nerrors or warnings will be sent to each center to correct. Each accepted file type has its own\nsubmission guidelines the centers must follow. Some examples of these validation checks are\ngiven below:\n\u2022 assay information file: SEQ_ASSAY_ID s must start with center abbreviation.\n\u2022 BED file: Start_Position must only be integers and is the 2nd column.\n\u2022 MAF file: T_ALT_COUNT must be an integer.\nEvery month the center files are merged and processed into the release files. During processing,\nspecific sample and variant filters and transformations are applied to the each center\u2019s vali-\ndated files. After processing, the release files go through some manual and automated review\nprocesses.\nFor more information on the filters and review processes, see below.\n5Sample Filters\nSequence Date\nSamples from every major release and its associated consortium releases are vetted by its\nSEQ_DATE . For instance, samples in the 5.0 consortium and public releases will only contain\nsamples that were sequenced prior to Jan-2018 (not including Jan-2018)\nNoBED file\nSamples that have a SEQ_ASSAY_ID that don\u2019t have a bed file associated with them will be\nremoved.\nOncotree\nSamples with deprecated codes (as defined by the oncotree source version used in the release)\nwill be removed.\ncfDNA\nAny sample with SAMPLE_CLASS that is cfDNA is removed from the public release.\nPatient and sampleretractions\n\u2022 Implicit retraction occurs when any data that is has been withdrawn from new uploads\nwill automatically be removed from the upcoming consortium/public releases.\n\u2022 Explicit retractions occurs when centers submit a patient or sample ID in their retraction\nfile. This may occur when a patient decides to retract their consent.\nAge information redac tion\nWhen AGE_AT_SEQ_REPORT ,INT_CONTACT , or INT_DOD is >32485 or <6570, the fields\nBIRTH_YEAR ,YEAR_CONTACT ,YEAR_DEATH ,INT_CONTACT ,INT_DOD , and AGE_AT_SEQ_REPORT\nare redacted. If the difference between the BIRTH_YEAR and YEAR_CONTACT orBIRTH_YEAR\nandYEAR_DEATH is greater than 89, those values will be redacted.\n\u2022 Intervals are redacted with \u201c>32485\u201d and \u201c<6570\u201d\n\u2022 Ages are redacted with \u201c>89\u201d and \u201c<18\u201d\n\u2022 Years are redacted with \u201ccannotReleaseHIPAA\u201d and \u201cwithheld\u201d .\nVariant Data Filters\nGermline Filter\n\u2022 All germline variants are filtered out in all releases.\n\u2013We added a whitelist of GRCh37 loci where pathogenic somatic events are known to\noccur. The whitelist can be viewed here (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mskcc/vcf2maf/v1.6.19/data/known_somatic_sites.bed).\n6\u2022 Genome Nexus reports gnomAD AFs by querying the Genome Aggregation Database\nto determine common variants. An additional filter named common_variant is also\nappended if allele count across at least one ExAC subpopulation is >10 (this default\ncutoff can be changed when running vcf2maf). If any variant has a max gnomAD AF\nfrom any subpopulation that is over 0.0005, the variant will be filtered out. This >10\nallele count (AC) cutoff was selected because it tagged no more than 1% of the somatic\ncalls across all MSK-IMPACT samples with patient-matched controls.\n\u2013So if you\u2019re handling somatic variants, the common_variant tag means this is likely\na false-positive. It is less likely to be a legit somatic variant at a site that ExAC\nclassifies as germline or artifact.\n\u2022 While the GENIE data available from Sage contains all mutation data, the following mu-\ntation types are automatically altered upon import into the cBioPortal: Silent, Intronic,\n3\u2019 UTR, 3\u2019 Flank, 5\u2019 UTR, 5\u2019 Flank and Intergenic region (IGR).\n\u2022 Seventeen of the nineteen GENIE participating centers performed tumor-only sequenc-\ning i.e. without also sequencing a patient-matched control sample like blood, to isolate\nsomatic events. These centers minimized artifacts and germline events using pooled con-\ntrols from unrelated individuals, or using databases of known artifacts, common germline\nvariants, and recurrent somatic mutations. However, there remains a risk that such cen-\nters may inadvertently release germline variants that can theoretically be used for pa-\ntient re-identication. To minimize this risk, the GENIE consortium developed a stringent\ngermline filtering pipeline, and applied it uniformly to all variants across all centers.\n\u2013Hotspots from Chang et al. minus some likely artifacts. (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3391)\n\u2013Somatic mutations associated with clonal hematopoietic expansion from Xie et\nal.

This filter looks\nfor close proximity variants (within 6bp) and difference of variant allele frequency between\ntwo variants (<0.05). Sites review the variants that are filtered out and select one of the three\noptions for this filter:\n\u2022 ON: Sage filters out all samples with variants flagged\n\u2022 OFF: If a center already does this filter prior to upload, the filter can be turned off\n\u2022 FLAG: The samples are not removed, but the variants are annotated in the maf file.\n(Discussed May 6th, 2019)\n7Genome Nexus Annotation Status\nVariants that are unable to be annotated by Genome Nexus are removed.\nProcessing Transformations\nGenome Nexus Annotation Pipeline\n\u2022 Contributing GENIE centers provided mutation data in Variant Call Format (VCF) or\nMutation Annotation Format (GDC MAF v1.0.0) with additionalfields for read counts\nsupporting variant alleles, reference alleles, and total depth. Some \u201cMAF-like\u201d text files\nwith minimal required columns were also received from the participating centers. These\nvarious input formats were converted into a complete tab-separated MAF format, with\nGenome Nexus.\n\u2022 The GENIE dataset is annotating all variants with Genome Nexus starting from the\n9.1-consortium release (instead of vcf2maf).\nGene symbolharmonization\nAll submitted HUGO gene symbols will be harmonized against GRCh37 by checking the\ncoordinates against the annotation. The below diagram illustrates how conflicts between\nsubmitted and harmonized symbols will be resolved.\n\u2022 Every single row of your bed file will be matched against the gene database. If the\nsubmitted symbol matches a row in the gene database and there is an overlap from the\nsubmitted bed region, the submitted symbol will be returned.\n\u2022 If the submitted symbol does not exist in the database or there is not any overlap, an\nattempt to find any gene that completely encapsulates the submitted bed region is made.\nIf the bed region is contained completely inside one gene, then it is labelled as that gene.\nIf a bed region is enclosed completely in more than one gene, and the submitted symbol\ndoesn\u2019t match any of the genes returned, NULL will be returned.\n\u2022 If the submitted region isn\u2019t enclosed in any gene, then calculations are made to check\nif the bed region resides at least 90% in a gene. If there is more than one gene returned\nwhile doing 90% boundary calculations, NULL is returned.\nCNA Value Harmonization\nOn a per site basis, if there are more two rows that are the same gene, the values are updated\nusing the following logic:\n\u2022 If there is one value, keep that value\n\u2022 If there are two values (e.g. 2 or 0), we take the non-zero value.\n\u2022 If there are two values that aren\u2019t zero (e.g. 1 and 2), it is NA.\n\u2022 If there are more than two values (e.g. 0 or 1 or 2), it is NA.\n8ClinicalTier Release Scope Filters\nSome parts of the clinical data is masked from the public releases. This is based on a clinical\ntier release scope of release document.\nPost-Release Quality Checks\nGENIE-ArtifactFinder\nFinds potential genomic artifacts by filtering unique variants for which counts in a given panel\n>= 10, and counts aggregated from all other panels is < 10 for which there are >= 3 different\npanels that cover the variant in question.\nThe resulting set is annotated with a fisher p-value for the variants that pass this filtering:\nNumber of variants called in panel Number of samples for this panel\nNumber of variants called in other panels with\ncoverage for this variantNumber of samples for panels with\ncoverage for this variant\nRelease Report\nAfter release, each center performs a manual review of their data based on an auto-generated\ndashboard that summarizes some key elements. Some examples of items sites review are given\nbelow:\n\u2022 Confirm sample count\n\u2022 Confirm variant count (flagged mutations). Most of these variants are potential artifacts\nflagged by manual review of cBioPortal. Suggestions for variants that should be part of\nthis list or any variant shouldn\u2019t be part of this list are welcome.\n\u2022 Fix BED and assay information discrepancies\n\u2022 Confirm top 5 most frequently mutated genes per pipeline for all non-synonymous mu-\ntations\n\u2022 Remove blacklisted variants\n\u2022 Confirm clinical attribute distributions/values are valid\n\u2022 Confirm patients and samples that were marked for retraction\nSummary of Sequence Pipeline\nTraditionally, the SEQ_ASSAY_ID was used as an institution\u2019s identifier for their assays\nwhen each assay had one associated gene panel. As GENIE grew, we wanted to support an\nassay having multiple gene panels. SEQ_ASSAY_ID was repurposed to be an identifier for a\n9center\u2019s assay OR panel. For those centers that have multiple panels per assay, we introduced\nSEQ_PIPELINE_ID (pipeline), which encompasses multiple SEQ_ASSAY_ID (panel).\n0.02.55.07.510.012.5\nWAKE\nVICC\nMSK\nCHOP\nUHN\nCOLU\nNKI\nPROV\nDFCI\nDUKE\nMDA\nJHU\nUCHI\nUCSF\nVHIO\nYALE\nCRUK\nGRCC\nSCI\nCenterNumber of Pipelines\n010203040\nHybrid Selection Other

Comprehensive Assay v3\nGenomic Profiling at Each Center\nChilrden\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)\nThe CHOP Comprehensive Solid Tumor Panel and Comprehensive Hematologic Cancer Pane\ninclude sequence and copy number analyses of 238 and 117 cancer genes, respectively, geno-\ntyping of two genes associated with cancer pharmacogenomics, and a Fusion Panel targeting\nover 700 exons of 117 cancer genes.\nNext generation sequencing (NGS) and data analysis: Nucleic acid is extracted from the pa-\ntient\u2019s sample following standard DNA and RNA extraction protocols. Extracted DNA is\nfragmented and tagged using SureSelect QXT target enrichment to generate adapter-tagged\nlibraries. Biotin-labeled probes specific to the targeted regions are used for capture hybridiza-\ntion. Libraries are enriched for the desired regions using streptavidin beads. Enriched libraries\nare then indexed and pooled for sequencing. Libraries are subject to sequence analysis on Il-\nlumina NovaSeq 6000 system for 150 bp paired end reads. All coding exons and the flanking\nintron sequences of targeted genes in the panel are sequenced, and selected promoter regions\n18and known intronic variants are also evaluated. Sequence data are analyzed using the home\nbrew software ConcordS V4.0.0 and NextGENe V2 NGS Analysis Software. Sequence vari-\nants within exons and 5 bp flanking intron sequences are annotated. Copy number variation\n(CNV) analysis for gross deletions and duplications are evaluated using NGS data. RNA se-\nquencing libraries are prepared using Archer Universal RNA Reagent Kit with CHOP fusion\npanel custom-designed primers with target specific molecular barcode. Sequencing data are\nanalyzed using ArcherTM Analysis for fusion genes. Clinically significant variants including\nsingle nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels, CNVs and fusion genes are confirmed by Sanger\nsequencing, MLPA, Real-Time PCR, or ddPCR only when necessary.\nVariant categorization and reporting: Sequence variants, copy number variants, and gene fu-\nsions are evaluated based on the currently available information from relevant resources, such\nas professional guidelines, clinical and population variant databases, tumor specific databases,\nand the scientific literature. Sequence variants are reported according to HGVS nomenclature\n[den Dunnen 2016, PMID: 26931183]. Somatic variants are classified using criteria consistent\nwith those recommended by the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), American So-\nciety of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and College of American Pathologists (CAP) [Li 2017,\nPMID: 27993330], as described below. Tier 1-3 variants are reported. Tier 4 variants are not\nreported.\nTPMT and NUDT15 genotyping: NUDT15 diplotypes 1 through 9, and TPMT diplotypes 1,2,\n3A,3B, and *3C, are assessed [Relling 2019, PMID: 30447069; CPIC Guideline for Thiopurines\nand TPMT and NUDT15].\nHerbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University (COLU)\nColumbia University Irving Medical Center uses the Illumina TruSeq Amplicon \u2013Cancer Panel\n(TSACP) to detect known cancer hotspots.DNA is extracted from unstained sections of FFPE\ntissue paired with an H&E stained section that is used to ensure adequate tumor cellularity\n(human assessment > 30%) and marking of the tumor region of interest (macrodissection).\nExtraction for FFPE tissue is performed on the QiaCube instrument (Qiagen). 50-250ng of\ngenomic DNA is used as input.Tumors are sequenced to an average depth of at least 1000X.\nAlignment (to hg19) and variant calling is performed using NextGENe v2.4.2software. Variants\nlower than 1% allele frequency in all three control populations (White, African American,\nAsian) of the Exome Variant Server database, the 1000 genome project database are retained,\nand annotation of variants is performed using a custom pipeline. All cases are reviewed and\ninterpreted by a molecular pathologist.\nCancer Research UK Cambridge Centre, University of Cambridge (CRUK)\nSequencing data (SNVs/Indels) :\n19DNA was quantified using Qubit HS dsDNA assay (Life Technologies, CA) and libraries were\nprepared from a total of 50 ng of DNA using Illumina\u2019s Nextera Custom Target Enrichment\nkit (Illumina, CA). In brief, a modified Tn5 transposase was used to simultaneously fragment\nDNA and attach a transposon sequence to both end of the fragments generated. This was\nfollowed by a limited cycle PCR amplification (11 cycles) using barcoded oligonucleotides that\nhave primer sites on the transposon sequence generating 96 uniquely barcoded libraries per\nrun. The libraries were then diluted and quantified using Qubit HS dsDNA assay.\nFive hundred nanograms from each library were pooled into a capture pool of 12 samples.\nEnrichment probes (80-mer) were designed and synthesized by Illumina; these probes were\ndesigned to enrich for all exons of the target genes, as well for 500 bp up- and downstream\nof the gene. The capture was performed twice to increase the specificity of the enrichment.\nEnriched libraries were amplified using universal primers in a limited cycle PCR (11 cycles).\nThe quality of the libraries was assessed using Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, CA) and\nquantified using KAPA Library Quantification Kits (Kapa Biosystems, MA).\nProducts from four capture reactions (that is, 48 samples) were pooled for sequencing in a\nlane of Illumina HiSeq 2,000. Sequencing (paired-end, 100 bp) of samples and demultiplexing\nof libraries was performed by Illumina (Great Chesterford, UK).\nThe sequenced reads were aligned with Novoalign, and the resulting BAM files were prepro-\ncessed using the GATK Toolkit. Sequencing quality statistics were obtained using the GATK\u2019s\nDepthOfCoverage tool and Picard\u2019s CalculateHsMetrics. Coverage metrics are presented in\nSupplementary Fig. 1. Samples were excluded if <25% of the targeted bases were covered at\na minimum coverage of 50x.\nThe identities of those samples with copy number array data available were confirmed by\nanalyzing the samples\u2019 genotypes at loci covered by the Affymetrix SNP6 array. Genotype calls\nfrom the sequencing data were compared with those from the SNP6 data that was generated\nfor the original studies. This was to identify possible contamination and sample mix-ups, as\nthis would affect associations with other data sets and clinical parameters.\nTo identify all variants in the samples, we used MuTect (without any filtering) for SNVs and\nthe Haplotype Caller for indels. All reads with a mapping quality <70 were removed prior\nto calling. Variants were annotated with ANNOVAR using the genes\u2019 canonical transcripts\nas defined by Ensembl. Custom scripts were written to identify variants affecting splice sites\nusing exon coordinates provided by Ensembl. Indels were referenced by the first codon they\naffected irrespective of length; for example, insertions of two bases and five bases at the same\ncodon were classed together.\nTo obtain the final set of mutation calls, we used a two-step approach, first removing any\nspurious variant calls arising as a consequence of sequencing artefacts (generic filtering) and\nthen making use of our normal samples and the existing data to identify somatic mutations\n(somatic filtering). For both levels of filtering, we used hard thresholds that were obtained,\nwherever possible, from the data itself. For example, some of our filtering parameters were\nderived from considering mutations in technical replicates (15 samples sequenced in triplicate).\n20We compared the distributions of key parameters (including quality scores, depth, VAF) for\nconcordant (present in all three replicates) and discordant (present in only one out of three\nreplicates) variants to obtain thresholds, and used ROC analysis to select the parameters that\nbest identified concordant variants.\nSNV filtering\n\u2022 Based on our analysis of replicates, SNVs with MuTect quality scores <6.95 were re-\nmoved.\n\u2022 We removed those variants that overlapped with repetitive regions of MUC16 (chromo-\nsome 19: 8,955,441\u20139,044,530). This segment contains multiple tandem repeats (mucin\nrepeats) that are highly susceptible to misalignment due to sequence similarity.\n\u2022 Variants that failed MuTect\u2019s internal filters due to \u2018nearby_gap_events\u2019 and\n\u2018poor_mapping_-regional_alternate_allele_mapq\u2019 were removed.\n\u2022 Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to identify variants exhibiting read direction bias (vari-\nants occurring significantly more frequently in one read direction than in the other;\nFDR=0.0001). These were filtered out from the variant calls.\n\u2022 SNVs present at VAFs smaller than 0.1 or at loci covered by fewer than 10 reads were\nremoved, unless they were also present and confirmed somatic in the Catalogue of So-\nmatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC). The presence of well-known PIK3CA mutations\npresent at low VAFs was confirmed by digital PCR (see below), and supported the use\nof COSMIC when filtering SNVs.\n\u2022 We removed all SNVs that were present in any of the three populations (AMR, ASN,\nAFR) in the 1,000 Genomes study (Phase 1, release 3) with a population alternate allele\nfrequency of >1%.\n\u2022 We used the normal samples in our data set (normal pool) to control for both sequencing\nnoise and germline variants, and removed any SNV observed in the normal pool (at a\nVAF of at least 0.1). However, for SNVs present in more than two breast cancer samples\nin COSMIC, we used more stringent thresholds, removing only those that were observed\nin >5% of normal breast tissue or in >1% of blood samples. The different thresholds\nwere used to avoid the possibility of contamination in the normal pool affecting filtering\nof known somatic mutations. This is analogous to the optional \u2018panel of normals\u2019 filtering\nstep used by MuTect in paired mode, in which mutations present in normal samples are\nremoved unless present in a list of known mutations61.\nIndel filtering\n\u2022 As for SNVs, we removed all indels falling within tandem repeats of MUC16 (coordinates\ngiven above).\n21\u2022 We removed all indels deemed to be of \u2018LowQual\u2019 by the Haplotype Caller with default\nparameters (Phred-scaled confidence threshold=30).\n\u2022 As for SNVs, we removed indels displaying read direction bias. Indels with strand bias\nPhred-scaled scores >40 were removed.\n\u2022 We downloaded the Simple Repeats and Microsatellites tracks from the UCSC Table\nBrowser, and removed all indels overlapping these regions. We also removed all indels\nthat overlapped homopolymer stretches of six or more bases.\n\u2022 As for SNVs, indels were removed if present in the 1,000 Genomes database at an allele\nfrequency >1%, or if they were present in normal samples in our data set. Thresholds\nwere adjusted as for SNVs if the indel was present in COSMIC. The same thresholds for\ndepth and VAF were used.\nMicroarray data (Copy number):\nDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. AS-\nCAT was used to obtain segmented copy number calls and estimates of tumour ploidy and\npurity. Somatic CNAs were obtained by removing germline CNVs as defined in the original\nMETABRIC study3. We defined regions of LOH as those in which there were no copies present\nof either the major or minor allele, irrespective of total copy number. Recurrent CNAs were\nidentified with GISTIC2, with log2 ratios obtained by dividing the total number of copies by\ntumour ploidy for each ASCAT segment. Thresholds for identifying gains and losses were set\nto 0.4 and (-)0.5, respectively; these values were obtained by examining the distribution of\nlog2 ratios to identify peaks associated with copy number states. A broad length cut-off of\n0.98 was used, and peaks were assessed to rule out probe artefacts and CNVs that may have\nbeen originally missed.\nDana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI)\nDFCI uses a custom, hybridization-based capture panel (OncoPanel) to detect single nucleotide\nvariants, small indels, copy number alterations, and structural variants from tumor-only se-\nquencing data. Three (3) versions of the panel have been submitted to GENIE:version 1\ncontaining 275 genes, version 2 containing 300 genes, version 3 containing 447 genes. Speci-\nmens are reviewed by a pathologist to ensure tumor cellularity of at least 20%. Tumors are\nsequenced to an average unique depth of coverage of approximately 200x for version 1 and\n350x for version 2. Reads are aligned using BWA, flagged for duplicate read pairs using Pi-\ncard Tools, and locally realigned using GATK. Sequence mutations are called using MuTect\nfor SNVs and GATK SomaticIndelDetector for small indels. Putative germline variants are\nfiltered out using a panel of historical normals or if present in ESP at a frequency \u2265.1%, unless\nthe variant is also present in COSMIC. Copy number alterations are called using a custom\npipeline and reported for fold-change >1. Structural rearrangements are called using BreaK-\nmer. Testing is performed for all patients across all solid tumor types. Version 3 includes the\n22exonicregions of 447 genes and 191 intronic regions across 60 genes targeted for rearrangement\ndetection. 52 genes present in previous versions were retired in the v3 test.\nDuke Cancer Institute (DUKE)\nFoundation medicine panels: Duke uses Illumina hybridization-based capture panels from\nFoundation Medicine to detect single nucleotide variants, small indels, copy number alterations\nand structural variants from FFPE, tumor-only sequencing data. Three gene panels were\nused: Panel 1 (T5a bait set), covering 326 genes, Panel 2 (T7 bait set), covering 434 genes,\nand Panel 3 (DX1 bait set), covering 324 genes. The clinical sequencing data were analyzed\nby Foundation Medicine-developed pipelines. Briefly: A pool of 5\u2019-biotinylated DNA 120bp\noligonucleotides were designed as baits with 60bp overlap in targeted exon regions and 20bp\noverlap in targeted introns with a minimum of 3 baits per target and 1 bait per SNP target.\nThe goal was a depth of sequencing between 750x and 1000x. Mapping to the reference\ngenome was accomplished using BWA, local alignment optimizations with GATK, and PCR\nduplicate read removal and sequence metric collection with Picard and Samtools. A Bayesian\nmethodology incorporating tissue-specific prior expectations allowed for detection of novel\nsomatic mutations at low MAF and increased sensitivity at hotspots. Final single nucleotide\nvariant (SNV) calls were made at MAF \u22655% (MAF \u22651% at hotspots) with filtering for\nstrand bias, read location bias and presence of two or more normal controls. Indels were\ndetected using the deBrujn approach of de novo local assembly within each targeted exon\nand through direct read alignment and then filtered as described for SNVs. Copy number\nalterations were detected utilizing a comparative genomic hybridization-like method to obtain\na log-ratio profile of the sample to estimate tumor purity and copy number. Absolute copy\nnumber was assigned to segments based on Gibbs sampling. To detect gene fusions, chimeric\nread pairs were clustered by genomic coordinates and clusters containing at least 10 chimeric\npairs were identified as rearrangement candidates.\nInstitut Gustave Roussy (GRCC)\nGustave Roussy Cancer Centre submitted data includes somatic variants (single nucleotide\nvariants and small indels) identified with CancerHotspot Panel v2 from tumor-only sequence\ndata. Several versions of the panel have been used: CHP2 covering hotspots in 50 genes,\nMOSC3 covering hotspots in 74 genes and MOSC4 covering 89 genes. Tumors are sequenced\nto an average unique depth of coverage of >500X. The sequencing data were analyzed with the\nTorrent SuiteTMVariant Caller 4.2 and higher and reported somatic variants were compared\nwith the reference genome GRCh37 (hg19). The variants were called if >5 reads supported\nthe variant and/or total base depth >50 and/or variant allele frequency >1% was observed.\nAll the variants identified were visually controlled on .bam files using Alamut v2.4.2 software\n(Interactive Biosoftware). All the germline variants found in 1000 Genomes Project or ESP\n23(Exome Sequencing Project database) with frequency >0.1% were removed. All somatic mu-\ntations were annotated, sorted, and interpreted by an expert molecular biologist according to\navailable databases (COSMIC, TCGA) and medical literature.\nThe submitted data set was obtained from selected patients that were included in the\nMOSCATO trial (Molecular Screening for CAncer Treatment Optimization) (NCT01566019).\nThis trial collected on-purpose tumour samples (from the primary or from a metastatic\nsite) that are immediately fresh-frozen, and subsequently analyzed for targeted gene panel\nsequencing. Tumour cellularity was assessed by a senior pathologist on a haematoxylin and\neosin slide from the same biopsy core to ensure tumor cellularity of at least 10%.\nJohns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (JHU)\nJohns Hopkins submitted genomic data from the Ion AmpliSeqCancer Hotspot Panel v2, which\ndetects mutations in cancer hotspots from tumor-only analysis. Data from the JHU_50GP_V2\npanel covering frequently mutated regions in 50 genes was submitted to GENIE. Pathologist in-\nspection of an H&E section ensured adequatetumor cellularity (approximately 10% or greater).\nDNA was extracted from the macro-dissected FFPE tumor region of interest. Tumors are se-\nquenced to an average unique read depth of coverage of greater than 500X. For alignment the\nTMAP aligner developed by Life Technology for the Ion Torrent sequencing platform is used to\nalign to hg19/GRCh37 using the manufacturer\u2019s suggested settings. Tumor variants are called\nwith a variety of tools. Samtools mpileup is run on the aligned .bam file and then processed\nwithcustom perl scripts (via a naive variant caller) to identify SNV and INS/DEL. Specimen\nvariant filters have a total read depth filter of \u2265100, a variant allele coverage of \u226510, variant\nallele frequency for substitutions \u22650.05, variant allele frequency for small (less than 50 base\npair) insertions or deletions \u22650.05, and \u201cstrand bias\u201d of total reads and of variant alleles\nare both less than 2-fold when comparing forward and reverse reads. Additionally, variants\nseen in greater than 20% of a set of non-neoplastic control tissues (>3 of 16 samples) with\nthe same filter criteria are excluded. Finally, variants documented as \u201ccommon\u201d in dbSNP\nand not known to COSMIC are excluded. The cohort includes both primary and metastatic\nlesions and some repeated sampling of the same patient.\nThe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDA)\nThe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center submitted data in the current data set\nincludes sequence variants (small indels and point mutations) identified using an amplicon-\nbased targeted hotspot tumor-only assay, and sequence variants/gene level amplifications\nidentified on anamplicon-based exonic gene panel which incorporates germline variant sub-\ntraction (MDA-409). Two different amplicon pools and pipeline versions are included for the\nhotspot tumor-only assays: a 46-gene assay (MDA-46) corresponding to customized version\nof AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel, v1 (Life Technologies), and a 50-gene assay (MDA-50)\ncorresponding to the AmpliSeq Hotspot Panel v2. The exonic assay with germline variant\n24subtraction and amplification detection corresponds to the AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer\nPanel. DNA wasextracted from unstained sections of tissue paired with astained section that\nwas used to ensure adequate tumor cellularity (human assessment > 20%) and marking of\nthe tumor region of interest (macrodissection). Sequencing was performed on an Ion Torrent\nPGM (hotspot) or Proton (exonic). Tumors were sequenced to a minimum depth of coverage\n(per amplicon) of approximately 250X. Bioinformatics pipeline for MDA-46 was executed using\nTorrentSuite 2.0.1 signal processing, basecalling, alignment and variant calling. For MDA-50,\nTorrentSuite 3.6 was used. Initial calls were made by Torrent Variant Caller (TVC) using\nlow-stringency somatic parameters. For MDA-50, TorrentSuite 3.6 was used. For MDA-409,\nTorrentSuite 4.4 was used. For MDA-409, TorrentSuite 4.4 was used. Initial calls were made\nby Torrent Variant Caller (TVC) using low-stringency somatic parameters. All called vari-\nants were parsed into a custom annotation & reporting system, OncoSeek, with a back-end\nSQL Server database using a convergent data model for all sequencing platforms used by the\nlaboratory. Calls were reviewed with initial low stringency to help ensure that low effective\ntumor cellularity samples do not get reported as false negative samples. Nominal variant filters\n(5% variantallelic frequency minimum, 25 variant coverage minimum, variant not present in\npaired germline DNA for the exonic assay) can then be applied dynamically. Clinical sequenc-\ning reports were generated using OncoSeek to transform genomic representations into HGVS\nnomenclature. To create VCF files for this project, unfiltered low stringency VCF files were\ncomputationally cross checked against a regular expressions-based variant extract from clinical\nreports. Only cases where all extracted variants from the clinical report were deterministically\nmappable to the unfiltered VCF file and corresponding genomic coordinates were marked for\ninclusion in this dataset. This method filters a small number of cases where complex indels may\nnot have originally been called correctly at the VCF level. Testing is performed for patients\nwith advanced metastatic cancer across all solid tumor types.\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK)\nMSK uses a custom, hybridization-based capture panel (MSK-IMPACT) to detect single nu-\ncleotide variants, small indels, copy number alterations, and structural variants from matched\ntumor-normal sequence data (a pool of normals is used for a small subset of samples with a\nmissing normal). Three (3) versions of the panel have been submitted to GENIE: version 1\ncontaining 341 genes, version 2 containing 410 genes, version 3 containing 468 genes. Speci-\nmens are reviewed by a pathologist to ensure tumor cellularity of at least 10%. Tumors are\nsequenced to an average unique depth of coverage of approximately 750X. Reads are aligned\nusing BWA, flagged for duplicate read pairs using GATK, and locally realigned using ABRA.\nSequence mutations are called using MuTect, VarDict, and Somatic indel detector, and re-\nported for >5% allele frequency (novel variants) or >2% allele frequency (recurrent hotspots).\nCopy number alterations are called using a custom pipeline and reported for fold-change >2.\nStructural rearrangements are called using Delly. All somatic mutations are reported with-\nout regard to biological function. Testing is performed for patients with advanced metastatic\ncancer across all solid tumor types.\n25Netherlands Cancer Center, The Netherlands (NKI)\nNKI uses Illumina TruSeq Amplicon \u2013Cancer Panel (TSACP) to detect known cancer hotspots\nfrom tumor-only sequencing data. A single gene panel, NKI-TSACP covering known hotspots\nin 48 genes with 212 amplicons has been used. Specimens are reviewed by a pathologist to\nensure tumor cellularity of at least 10%. Tumors are sequenced to an average unique depth\nof coverage of approximately 4000x. The sample plate and sample sheet are made using the\nIllumina Experiment Manager software before running the sample on the MiSeq Sequencing\nSystem (Illumina, SY-410-1003) and MiSeq Reporter (v2.5) is used for data analysis. Reads are\naligned using Banded Smith Waterman (v2.5.1.3), and samtools isused to further sort and index\nthe BAM files. Variant calling is performed via the Illumina somatic variant caller (v3.5.2.1).\nFurther detailed variant analysis (e.g. removal of known artifacts, known benign SNPs and\nvariants with read depth < 200 or VAF < 0.05 and manual classification) is performed via\nCartagenia BenchLab (https://cartagenia.com/). Testing is performed for all patients across\nall solid tumor types.\nProvidence Health & Services Cancer Institute (PROV)\nPROV has submitted data from two assays: PROV-focus-v1 and PROV-triseq-v1. For the\nPROV-focus-v1 we have employed the Thermo Fisher Oncomine Focus Assay for amplification\nof 52 genes from DNA extracted from macro-dissected FFPE samples taken from Pathologist\nspecified tumor regionsof interest (ROIs), with 20% minimal tumor cellularity. Samples include\nprimary and metastatic tumor ROIs. The assay is a tumor only assay, no paired \u201cnormal\u201d\nDNA is extracted from each case.\nThe PROV-focus-v1 BED file describes the positions of the genome assayed by the PROV-\nfocus-v1 panel relative to hg19.\nAmplification products are sequenced on the Life Technology Ion Torrent platform to an\naverage read depth of coverage greater than 500X average per base coverage.\nThe TMAP aligner developed by Life Technology for the ION torrent sequencing platform was\nused to align reads to hg19 using the manufacture suggested settings. Variants are called with\nthe Torrent Suite Variant Caller 4.2 software plug-in.\nVariant filters requiring a total read depth of greater than 100X, variant allele coverage of\ngreater than 10X, and a variant allele frequency for substitutions of greater than or equal to\n0.03 are applied. Also, the specimen variant must not be annotated as \u201cCOMMON\u201d (a variant\nallele frequency for substitutions of \u22650.05) in dnSNP. VCF files were created for upload to\nGENIE 6.1 by further filtering all detected variants to only those reported after expert review\nby clinicians.\nFor the PROV-triseq-v1 we used DNA extracted from macro-dissected FFPE samples taken\nfrom Pathologist specified tumor regions of interest (ROIs), with 20% minimal tumor cellularity\n26for extraction of tumor DNA, and whole peripheral blood for extraction of normal DNA. Tumor\nsamples include both primary and metastatic tumor ROIs.\nThe PROV-triseq-v1 BED file describes the positions of the genome assayed by the PROV-\ntriseq-v1 panel relative to hg19.\nLibraries are prepared using the KAPA for Illumina reagents protocols. Indexed libraries are\npooled for exome capture on the xGen V1.0 panel (https://www.idtdna.com/). Sequencing is\nperformed on Illumina 2500, 4000, or Novaseq platforms.\nRaw sequencing data in the form of BCL files are uploaded to the Providence secure computing\ncloud environment maintained by Amazon Web Services. Following upload, raw files are\nconverted to unaligned reads in FASTQ format using the software program bcl2fastq2, and\nresultant FASTQ files are aligned to the hg19 human reference genome using the Burrows-\nWheeler Aligner (BWA). Aligned reads in the SAM format are subsequently converted to\nbinary BAM format using the samtools software package, and aligned reads are processed for\nsingle-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions and deletions (indels) using our custom\nvariant calling pipeline (see below). FASTQ and aligned BAM files are analyzed with FastQC\nand Picard metrics for Molecular Genomics Lab staff run-level and sample-level review.\nThe Providence variant calling pipeline includes multiple variant calling algorithms including\nVarScan2, SomaticSniper, Mutect2 and Strelka. Variant filters requiring a total read depth of\ngreater than 100X, variant allele coverage of greater than 10X, and a variant allele frequency\nfor substitutions of greater than or equal to 0.03 are applied. Calls with low-quality variants,\nsilent mutations, and germline variants are also filtered. Annotations from SnpEff, ClinVar,\nExAC, 1000 Genomes, ANNOVAR, and COSMIC are incorporated for each call. Finally, all\ncommon variants, with non-zero allele frequencies the ExAC or 1000 Genomes databases, are\nremoved.\nGENIE 6.1 VCF files containing annotated calls from Mutect2 were created for upload to\nGENIE 6.1.\nSwedish Cancer Institute (SCI)\nSCI uses CellNetixPMP gene panel to detect hotspot mutations in known cancer genes from\nsolid tumor DNA (Formalin-fixed, para\ufb00in-embedded tissue). The hotspot gene panel covers\n68 genes. Tumor cell content is greater than 10% verified by pathologist. Tumor DNA is\nsequenced to >200x on average (Variant that allele frequency is less than 10% requires more\nthan 400X) on Illumina MiSeq (TruSeq Amplicon) platform, and data is analyzed in MiSeq\nReporter 2.5. Reads are aligned to hg19 reference genome by the BWA (v0.6.1-r104-tpx) aligner\nadapted by the MiSeq Reporter Software (v2.4.1 or v2.5) using the manufacture suggested\nsettings. MiSeq Reporter provided Somatic Variant Caller (v2.1.12) is run on the aligned\n.bam files to identify variants present in DNA samples. Detailed stepsplease refer toIllumina\nMiSeq Reporter User Guide. Variants are filtered for allele frequency greater than 3% except\n27for actionable mutations. Variants that are observed in \u226575% samples on the same run, or\ncommon variant with population frequency of > 50%, or average population frequency >5%\nreported in the 1000 genome and/or in ExAc. are filtered.\nThe University of Chicago (UCHI)\nNot Available\nUniversity of California-San Francisco (UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer\nCenter) (UCSF)\nUCSF uses a custom, hybridization-based capture panel (UCSF500) to detect single nucleotide\nvariants, small indels, copy number alterations, and structural variants from both matched\ntumor-normal and tumor-only specimens. Two versions of the panel have been submitted to\nGENIE: UCSF-NIMV4 consists of 481 genes and includes coverage of select promoter regions\n(TERT and SDHD) as well as the intronic or UTR regions of 47 genes for the detection of\nstructural rearrangements. UCSF-IDTV5 consists of 529 genes, retains TERT and SDHD\npromoter coverage, and expands intronic or UTR region coverage to 73 genes for the detection\nof structural rearrangements. Testing is performed for patients with solid or hematological\nmalignancies. Specimens are reviewed by a pathologist to ensure tumor cellularity of greater\nthan 25%. Tumor DNA is extracted from sections of FFPE tissue; for uveal melanoma cases,\nfrozen fresh fine needle aspirates are accepted. Normal DNA can be extracted from peripheral\nblood draw, buccal swab, or micro-dissected non-lesional areas. Hybridization capture is\nperformed with SeqCap EZ target enrichment kit; sequencing platform is the HiSeq2500 prior\nto October 2020, and NovaSeq6000 after. Tumors are sequenced to an average unique depth\nof coverage of approximately >500X. FASTQC is run on unaligned sequencing reads to collect\nread-level summary statistics for downstream quality control; additionally, a suite of Picard\ntools are also run to assess quality metrics from sequencing runs. BWA-MEM aligner is used\nto align sequencing reads from each sample to the reference genome (hg19). The following\nbioinformatic workflows are used for variant calling:\nSNV callers\n\u2022 Tumor sample: FreeBayes, GATK UnifiedGenotyper, Pindel Normal sample: FreeBayes,\nGATK HaplotypeCaller, Pindel\n\u2022 Matched pairs: FreeBayes, Mutect, GATK SomaticIndelDetector\nStructural variant callers\n\u2022 DELLY\n\u2022 Pindel calls larger than 100bp are treated as structural variants\n28Copy Number Calls\n\u2022 CNVkit using a reference profile for normalization of approximately 30 pooled normal\nsamples\nVariants are removed if present with frequency \u22651% in ESP6500, 1000 Genomes, or ExAC\ndatasets. Known sequencing artifacts are removed. Variants with < 50x total coverage in the\ntumor sample are removed.\nPrincess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN)\nPrincess Margaret Cancer Centre used three (6) panels to sequence samples - UHN-48-V1,\nUHN-50-V2, UHN-54-V1, UHN-555-V1, UHN-555-V2 and UHN-OCAv3. Each panel is de-\nscribed below:\nIllumina TruSeq Amplicon panel (UHN-48-V1): Princess Margaret Cancer Centre used the\nTruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel (TSACP, Illumina) to detect single nucleotide variants and\nsmall indels from matched tumor-normal sequencing data. Specimens are reviewed by a pathol-\nogist to ensure tumor cellularity of at least 20%. Tumors are sequenced to an average unique\ndepth of coverage of approximately 500x and normal blood samples to 100x. Data was pro-\ncessed using one of two workflows:\n\u2022 Data analysis of tumor-normal pairs processed by UHN\\_TSACP\\_workflow\\_v2:\nMiSeq fastq were aligned using (MiSeq Reporter v2.4.60 and the corresponding default\nversion of hg19) followed by local realignment and BQSR using GATK v3.3.0. Somatic\nsequence mutations were called, using MuTect (v1.1.5) for SNVs and Varscan (v2.3.8)\nfor indels, using both normal and tumor data. Data were filtered to ensure there are\nno variants included with frequency of 3% or more in the normal sample. Results were\nfiltered to keep only those with tumor variant allele frequency of at least 10%.\n\u2022 Data analysis of tumor only processed by UHN_TSACP_tumorONLY_v2_workflow:\nMiSeq fastq were aligned using (MiSeqReporter v2.4.60 and the corresponding default\nversion of hg19) followed by local realignment and BQSR using GATK v3.3.0. Sequence\nmutations (SNV and indel) were called using Varscan (v2.3.8). Results were filtered to\nkeep only those with tumor variant allele frequency of at least 10%.\nThermoFisher Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel (UHN-50-V2): Princess Margaret Cancer Cen-\ntre also used the TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel (TSACP, Illumina) to detect single nu-\ncleotide variants and small indels from matched tumor-normal sequencing data. Specimens\nwere reviewed by a pathologist to ensure tumor cellularity of at least 20%. Tumors were\nsequenced to an average unique depth of coverage of approximately 500x and normal blood\n29samples to 100x. Ion Torrent data was converted to fastq and sequences were aligned us-\ning NextGENe Software v2.3.1. NextGENe Software v2.3.1 provides a version of hg19 (Hu-\nman_v37_3_dbsnp_135_dna). NextGENe was used to call SNV and indels. Results were\nthen filtered to keep all with VAF of at least 10% and total coverage of at least 100x.\nIllumina TruSeq Myeloid Sequencing Panel (UHN-54-V1): Princess Margaret Cancer Centre\nalso used the TruSeq Myeloid Sequencing Panel (Illumina) to detect single nucleotide variants\nand small indels in DNA from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from patients with\nacute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myeloproliferative neoplasms. The diagnosis\nof each patient was confirmed by hematopathologist using the 2016 revision of the World\nHealth Organization classification system for myeloid neoplasms. Tumors were sequenced to\nan average unique depth of coverage of approximately 500x. MiSeq fastq were aligned using\n(MiSeq Reporter v2.4.60 and the corresponding default version of hg19). MiSeq Reporter\nwas then used to call variants. In the \u201cIllumina Experiment Manager\u201d, \u201cTruSeq Amplicon\nWorkflow \u2013specific settings\u201d were adjusted as follows: \u201cExport to gVCF \u2013MaxIndelSize\u201d from\ndefault \u201c25\u201d to \u201c55\u201d . Results were then filtered to keep only those with tumor variant allele\nfrequency of at least 10% and a depth of coverage greater than 500x.\nUHN Custom 555 Gene Panel (UHN-555-V1 and UHN-55-V2): Princess Margaret Cancer\nCentre used a custom Sure Select (Agilent) 555 gene panel to detect single nucleotide variants\nand small indels in DNA from tumour tissue. Specimens are reviewed by a pathologist to\nensure tumor cellularity of at least 10% (usually >20%). Tumors are sequenced to an average\nunique depth of coverage of approximately 500x. NextSeq fastq were aligned using bwa-mem\nand the BAMs were processed using GATK best practices. Variants were called using VarScan\nv2.3.8. VCF files were filtered to remove known artifacts. Variants that are not on a manually\ncurated list of hotspots that have depth less than 50, or if depth 50 to 100 with frequency\n<10%, or if depth was at least 100 with frequency <5%, were removed.\nIon Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3 (UHN-OCAv3): Princess Margaret Cancer Centre\nused the Thermofisher Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3 to detect relevant single nucleotide\nvariants, small indels, copy number changes and gene fusions. Genomic DNA and RNA\nwere co-isolated and then sequencing was performed on the Ion S5 XL System. Variant calls\nwere generated using Torrent Browser 5.12 (ThermoFisher) with alignment to genome build\nGRCh37/hg19. Filtering of reportable variants uses the Oncomine Variant Annotator plugin\nto annotate variants in Ion Reporter 5.12, with variant criteria and thresholds as supplied.\nThe reportable range is 5%-100% variant allele frequency. Minimum acceptable coverage for\nall reported genomic regions is >200x. Copy number gains and losses are assessed using the\nOncomine Variant Annotator plugin, with thresholds of <0.5 or >4 copies reported. Gene\nfusions are assessed using the Oncomine Variant Annotator plugin, with variant criteria and\nthresholds as supplied (quality threshold of >500,000 reads reported as \u2018pass\u2019 for gene fusion\nsequencing). The assay detects recurrent and novel gene partners with expressed gene fusions\nof the genes listed and minimum acceptable read count for all reported fusions is >2000.\n30Vall d\u2019Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO)\nVall d\u2019Hebron institute of Oncology (VHIO) submitted data that includes somatic variants\n(single nucleotide variants and small indels) identified with VHIO Card Amplicon panels that\ntarget frequently mutated regions in oncogenes and tumor suppressors. A total of fifteen panels\nhave been submitted taking different tumor types into consideration. The panels are:\n\u2022 VHIO-GENERAL-V01: Panel containing 56 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes\n\u2022 VHIO-BRAIN-V01 (General + NF1 v1: 57 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-BILIARY-V01 (General + *FGFR v1 + **NOTCH v1: 59 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-COLORECTAL-V01 (General + RingFingers v1 + **NOTCH v1: 60 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-HEAD-NECK-V1 (General + MTOR v1 + **NOTCH v1: 61 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-ENDOMETRIUM-V01 (General + RingFingers v1 + *FGFR v1 + NF1 v1: 60\ngenes)\n\u2022 VHIO-GASTRIC-V01 (General + RingFingers v1 + MTOR v1 + **NOTCH v1: 63\ngenes)\n\u2022 VHIO-PAROTIDE-V01 (General + **NOTCH v1: 58 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-BREAST-V01 (General + *FGFR v1 + **NOTCH v1+ GATA3 v1: 60 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-OVARY-V01 (General + BRCA v1: 58 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-PANCREAS-V01 (General + Ring Fingers v1 + BRCA v1: 60 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-SKIN-V01 (General + NF1 v1 + MTOR v1: 60 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-LUNG-V01 (General + NF1 v1 + MET v1 + FGFRw7 v1: 58 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-KIDNEY-V01 (General + MTOR v1: 59 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-URINARY-BLADDER-V01 (General + *FGFR v1 + NF1 v1 + MTOR v1: 61\ngenes)\n*FGFRv1 panel includes extra regions in FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes. **NOTCHv1\npanel includes extra regions in FBXW7 and NOTCH1 genes. FGFRw7 v1 panel includes extra\nregions in FGFR1 gene. MET v1 panel includes intronic regions flanking Exon 14 of MET\ngene.\nTumor samples are reviewed by a pathologist to ensure tumor cellularity of at least 20%.\nFor the sample loading into tumor-specific panels, we use a FREEDOM EVO 150 Platform\nfrom TECAN. Tumors are sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq instrument, to an average depth of\ncoverage of approximately 1000X. Samples are sequenced, and two independent chemistries are\nperformed and sequenced. Sequencing reads are aligned (BWA v0.7.17, Samtools v1.9), base\nrecalibrated, Indel realigned (GATK v3.7.0), and variant called (VarScan2 v2.4.3). A minimum\n31of 7 reads supporting the variant allele is required in order to call a mutation. Frequent\nSNPs in the population are filtered with the 1000g database (MAF>0.005). The average\nnumber of reads representing a given nucleotide in the panel (Sample Average Coverage) is\ncalculated. Manual curation of variants is performed after manual search of available literature\nand databases, in terms of their clinical significance.\n\u2022 VHIO-300 panel\nDNA from tumor-FFPE sample was obtained (Maxwell\u00ae RSC FFPE Plus DNA Kit\n(Promega)) and a custom gene capture approach (see below) performed (enrichment probes:\nSureSelect XT, Agilent). The resulting library was sequenced using the Illumina sequencing\nby synthesis (SBS) technology (2 x 100 PE run).\nSequencing reads were aligned (BWA v0.7.17, Samtools v1.9) against the hg19 reference\ngenome, base recalibrated, indel realigned (GATK v3.7.0, abra2 v2.23) and variant called\n(VarScan2 v2.4.3, Mutect2 v4.1.0.0). Variants from both callers are reported. A minimum\nof 5 reads supporting the variant allele were required to call a mutation. The sensitivity of\nthe technique is 5% MAF for SNVs and 10% MAF for INDELs. Frequent single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) in the population were filtered based on the gnomAD database (allele\nfrequency \u0e00 0.0001) and copy number alterations (CNA) were calculated (CN- Vkit v0.9.6.dev0).\nVariants were manually curated and classification of identified variants was performed using\npublicly available databases (COSMIC, cBioPortal, ClinVar, VarSome, OncoKB).\nVanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC)\nFoundation medicine panels: VICC uses Illumina hybridization-based capture panels from\nFoundation Medicine to detect single nucleotide variants, small indels, copy number alterations\nand structural variants from tumor-only sequencing data. Two gene panels were used: Panel\n1 (T5a bait set), covering 326 genes and; and Panel 2 (T7 bait set), covering 434 genes. DNA\nwas extracted from unstained FFPE sections, and H&E stained sections were used to ensure\nnucleated cellularity \u226580% and tumor cellularity \u226520%, with use of macro-dissection to enrich\nsamples with \u226420% tumor content. A pool of 5\u2019-biotinylated DNA 120bp oligonucleotides\nwere designed as baits with 60bp overlap in targeted exon regions and 20bp overlap in targeted\nintrons with a minimum of 3 baits per target and 1 bait per SNP target. The goal was a depth\nof sequencing between 750x and 1000x. Mapping to the reference genome was accomplished\nusing BWA, local alignment optimizations with GATK, and PCR duplicate read removal and\nsequence metric collection with Picard and Samtools. A Bayesian methodology incorporating\ntissue-specific prior expectations allowed for detection of novel somatic mutations at low MAF\nand increased sensitivity at hotspots. Final single nucleotide variant (SNV) calls were made\nat MAF \u22655% (MAF \u22651% at hotspots) with filtering for strand bias, read location bias and\npresence of two or more normal controls. Indels were detected using the deBrujn approach of\nde novo local assembly within each targeted exon and through direct read alignment and then\nfiltered as described for SNVs. Copy number alterations were detected utilizing a comparative\n32genomic hybridization-like method to obtain a log-ratio profile of the sample to estimate tumor\npurity and copy number. Absolute copy number was assigned to segments based on Gibbs\nsampling. To detect gene fusions, chimeric read pairs were clustered by genomic coordinates\nand clusters containing at least 10 chimeric pairs were identified as rearrangement candidates.\nRare tumors and metastatic samples were prioritized for sequencing, but ultimately sequencing\nwas at the clinician\u2019s discretion.\nVICC also submitted data from 2 smaller hotspot amplicon panels, one used for all myeloid\n(VICC-01-myeloid) tumors and 1 used for some solid tumors (VICC-01-solidtumor). These\npanels detect point mutations and small indels from 37 and 31 genes, respectively. Solid\ntumor H&E were inspected to ensure adequate tumor cellularity (>10%). Sections were\nmacrodissected if necessary, and DNA was extracted. Tumors were sequenced to an aver-\nage depth greater than 1000X. Reads were aligned to hg19/GRCh37 with novoalign, and\nsingle nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions greater than 5% were called utilizing a cus-\ntomized bioinformatic pipeline. Large (15bp and greater) FLT3 insertions were called using a\nspecialized protocol and were detected to a 0.5% allelic burden.\nWake Forest University Health Sciences, Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center (WAKE)\nWe utilized thesequencing analysis pipelines from Foundation Medicine and Caristo analyze\nclinical samples and support.Enrichment of target sequences was achieved by solution-based\nhybrid capture with custom biotinylated oligonucleotide bases. Enriched libraries were se-\nquenced to an average median depth of >500\u00d7 with 99% of bases covered >100\u00d7 (Illumi-\nnaHiSeq2000 platform using 49 \u00d7 49 paired-end reads).The clinical sequencing data were\nanalyzed by Foundation Medicine and Carisdevelopedpipelines.Sequenced readswere mapped\nto the reference human genome (hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner and the publicly\navailable SAM tools, Picard, and Genome Analysis Toolkit. Point mutations were identified\nby a Bayesian algorithm; short insertions and deletions determined by local assembly; gene\ncopy numberalterations identified by comparison to process-matched normal controls; and\ngene fusions/rearrangements determined by clustering chimeric reads mapped to targeted in-\ntrons.Following by computational analysis with tools such asMutSigand CHASM, the driver\nmutations can be identified which may help the selection of treatment strategy. In addition,\nthe initial report of the analysis of 470 cases has been published and highlightedon the cover\nof the journalTheranosticsin 2017.\nYale University, Yale Cancer Center (YALE)\nGENIE samples submitted by Yale belong to one of three targeted NGS panels (1) YALE-\nHSM-V1, (2) YALE-OCP-V2, or (3) YALE-OCP-V3. The first panel corresponds to the\nThermofisher Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2, which is designed to assess hotspot vari-\nants in 50 of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer, and is performed as a tumor-only\n33analysis. The latter two panels refer to v2 and v3C of the Thermofisher Oncomine Comprehen-\nsive Assay, which provides a more comprehensive assessment of somatic alterations including\nsingle nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions, copy number alterations (CNAs), and gene\nfusions across 143 and 161 genes, respectively. Target region design (i.e. full exonic, hotspot\nonly, intronic, promoter) varies based on known relevance of each gene. Pathologist inspection\nof an H&E section ensured adequate tumor cellularity (approximately 10% or greater). Tumor\nsamples are enriched for malignant cells by manual microdissection of unstained formalin-fixed,\npara\ufb00in-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. If available, germline control DNA from the same\npatient is obtained either from FFPE non-tumor tissue, from the patient\u2019s blood, or from\na buccal swab. Subsequent libraries are barcoded and sequenced on either an Ion Torrent\nPGM\u2122 or an Ion S5\u2122 XL next generation sequencer.\nPre-processing and alignment of reads is performed within Torrent Suite, with TMAP serving\nas the alignment algorithm. Resulting BAM files are uploaded to the Ion Reporter software\nfor variant detection, as well as CNA and gene fusion assessment for Oncomine samples. The\nbioinformatics pipeline also uses MuTect2 (GATK) and Strelka (Illumina) to assess somatic\nvariants. Variants are initially filtered based on quality metrics; a minimum read depth of 20x\nand avariant allelic fraction (VAF) of 0.02 is required. All variants passing quality filters are\npassed through the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor for variant annotation. Variants that\nare intronic or synonymous are filtered at this stage; all other variants are manually reviewed\nfor accuracy before submission to the attending pathologist. Variants below a VAF below\n0.05 are not typically reviewed unless tumor cellularity estimates are low. CNA assessment is\nperformed using the IonReporter CNV algorithm,as well as an internally developed workflow\nthat uses the DNAcopy R package. Custom visualizations for amplified genes are used to\nconfirm accuracy of CNAs reported by the pipeline. Only CNAs with a ploidy of 5 or higher\nare reported. Gene fusion assessment is handled by a custom workflow in the Ion Reporter\nsoftware which aligns cDNA reads to known fusion breakpoints. A fusion read is mapped\nsuccessfully if there is an overlap of 70% and exact matches of 66.66%.\nDescription of Data Files\nDescription on most of the data files can be found in the cBioPortal file formats docs.\ndata_mutations_extended.txt\n\u2022 Description: The mutation data file extends the Mutation Annotation Format (MAF)\ncreated as part of the Cancer Genome Atlas project, by adding extra annotations to each\nmutation record.\n\u2022 Details: MAF format\ndata_clinical_patient.txt/data_clinical_sample.txt\n34\u2022 Description: The clinical data is used to capture both clinical attributes and the mapping\nbetween patient and sample IDs.\n\u2022 Details: Clinical format\ndata_CNA.txt\n\u2022 Description: The copy number data file contain values that would be derived from copy-\nnumber analysis algorithms like GISTIC or RAE.

The GENIE platform will integrate and link clinical-grade cancer genomic\ndata with clinical outcome data for tens of thousands of cancer patients treated at multiple\ninternational institutions. The project fulfills an unmet need in oncology by providing the\nstatistical power necessary to improve clinical decision-making, to identify novel therapeutic\ntargets, to understand of patient response to therapy, and to design new biomarker-driven\nclinical trials. The project will also serve as a prototype for aggregating, harmonizing, and\nsharing clinical-grade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data obtained during routine medical\npractice.\nThe data within GENIE is being shared with the global research community. The database\ncurrently contains CLIA-/ISO-certified genomic data obtained during the course of routine\npractice at multiple international institutions (Table 1), and will continue to grow as more\npatients are treated at additional participating centers.\nHuman Subjects Protection and Privacy\nProtection of patient privacy is paramount, and the AACR Project GENIE therefore requires\nthat each participating center share data in a manner consistent with patient consent and\ncenter-specific Institutional Review Board (IRB) policies. The exact approach varies by cen-\nter, but largely falls into one of three categories: IRB-approved patient-consent to sharing of\n4de-identified data, captured at time of molecular testing; IRB waivers and; and IRB approvals\nof GENIE-specific research proposals. Additionally, all data has been de-identified via the\nHIPAA Safe Harbor Method. Full details regarding the HIPAA Safe Harbor Method are\navailable online at: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-\nidentification/.\nData Hamonization & QC Process\nThe GENIE dataset is generated from data curated by multiple cancer centers. Each center\nprepares their data by uploading their files onto the Synapse platform.\nRequired files:\n\u2022 Clinical patient and sample data\n\u2022 Variant data (MAF or VCF file)\n\u2022 Assay information\n\u2022 Genomic regions data (BED file)\nOptional files:\n\u2022 Structural variant data\n\u2022 Segmented data\n\u2022 Discrete copy number data\n\u2022 Mutations in cis data\n\u2022 Sample and/or patient retraction file\nOnly validated files that adhere to the submission guidelines will be pushed to the release. The\nfiles that do not pass these validation checks will not be processed and an email notifying any\nerrors or warnings will be sent to each center to correct. Each accepted file type has its own\nsubmission guidelines the centers must follow. Some examples of these validation checks are\ngiven below:\n\u2022 assay information file: SEQ_ASSAY_ID s must start with center abbreviation.\n\u2022 BED file: Start_Position must only be integers and is the 2nd column.\n\u2022 MAF file: T_ALT_COUNT must be an integer.\nEvery month the center files are merged and processed into the release files. During processing,\nspecific sample and variant filters and transformations are applied to the each center\u2019s vali-\ndated files. After processing, the release files go through some manual and automated review\nprocesses.\nFor more information on the filters and review processes, see below.\n5Sample Filters\nSequence Date\nSamples from every major release and its associated consortium releases are vetted by its\nSEQ_DATE . For instance, samples in the 5.0 consortium and public releases will only contain\nsamples that were sequenced prior to Jan-2018 (not including Jan-2018)\nNoBED file\nSamples that have a SEQ_ASSAY_ID that don\u2019t have a bed file associated with them will be\nremoved.\nOncotree\nSamples with deprecated codes (as defined by the oncotree source version used in the release)\nwill be removed.\ncfDNA\nAny sample with SAMPLE_CLASS that is cfDNA is removed from the public release.\nPatient and sampleretractions\n\u2022 Implicit retraction occurs when any data that is has been withdrawn from new uploads\nwill automatically be removed from the upcoming consortium/public releases.\n\u2022 Explicit retractions occurs when centers submit a patient or sample ID in their retraction\nfile. This may occur when a patient decides to retract their consent.\nAge information redac tion\nWhen AGE_AT_SEQ_REPORT ,INT_CONTACT , or INT_DOD is >32485 or <6570, the fields\nBIRTH_YEAR ,YEAR_CONTACT ,YEAR_DEATH ,INT_CONTACT ,INT_DOD , and AGE_AT_SEQ_REPORT\nare redacted. If the difference between the BIRTH_YEAR and YEAR_CONTACT orBIRTH_YEAR\nandYEAR_DEATH is greater than 89, those values will be redacted.\n\u2022 Intervals are redacted with \u201c>32485\u201d and \u201c<6570\u201d\n\u2022 Ages are redacted with \u201c>89\u201d and \u201c<18\u201d\n\u2022 Years are redacted with \u201ccannotReleaseHIPAA\u201d and \u201cwithheld\u201d .\nVariant Data Filters\nGermline Filter\n\u2022 All germline variants are filtered out in all releases.\n\u2013We added a whitelist of GRCh37 loci where pathogenic somatic events are known to\noccur. The whitelist can be viewed here (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mskcc/vcf2maf/v1.6.19/data/known_somatic_sites.bed).\n6\u2022 Genome Nexus reports gnomAD AFs by querying the Genome Aggregation Database\nto determine common variants. An additional filter named common_variant is also\nappended if allele count across at least one ExAC subpopulation is >10 (this default\ncutoff can be changed when running vcf2maf). If any variant has a max gnomAD AF\nfrom any subpopulation that is over 0.0005, the variant will be filtered out. This >10\nallele count (AC) cutoff was selected because it tagged no more than 1% of the somatic\ncalls across all MSK-IMPACT samples with patient-matched controls.\n\u2013So if you\u2019re handling somatic variants, the common_variant tag means this is likely\na false-positive. It is less likely to be a legit somatic variant at a site that ExAC\nclassifies as germline or artifact.\n\u2022 While the GENIE data available from Sage contains all mutation data, the following mu-\ntation types are automatically altered upon import into the cBioPortal: Silent, Intronic,\n3\u2019 UTR, 3\u2019 Flank, 5\u2019 UTR, 5\u2019 Flank and Intergenic region (IGR).\n\u2022 Seventeen of the nineteen GENIE participating centers performed tumor-only sequenc-\ning i.e. without also sequencing a patient-matched control sample like blood, to isolate\nsomatic events. These centers minimized artifacts and germline events using pooled con-\ntrols from unrelated individuals, or using databases of known artifacts, common germline\nvariants, and recurrent somatic mutations. However, there remains a risk that such cen-\nters may inadvertently release germline variants that can theoretically be used for pa-\ntient re-identication. To minimize this risk, the GENIE consortium developed a stringent\ngermline filtering pipeline, and applied it uniformly to all variants across all centers.\n\u2013Hotspots from Chang et al. minus some likely artifacts. (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3391)\n\u2013Somatic mutations associated with clonal hematopoietic expansion from Xie et\nal. (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nm.3733) \u0e00\n\u2013Somatically mutable germline sites at MSH6:F1088, TP53:R290, TERT:E280,\nASXL1:G645_G646.\nMAF inBED\nAny variants in the mutation file that isn\u2019t described by the bed file will be filtered out\nMutations -in-cis\nSamples that have variants that could be merged together will be filtered out. This filter looks\nfor close proximity variants (within 6bp) and difference of variant allele frequency between\ntwo variants (<0.05). Sites review the variants that are filtered out and select one of the three\noptions for this filter:\n\u2022 ON: Sage filters out all samples with variants flagged\n\u2022 OFF: If a center already does this filter prior to upload, the filter can be turned off\n\u2022 FLAG: The samples are not removed, but the variants are annotated in the maf file.\n(Discussed May 6th, 2019)\n7Genome Nexus Annotation Status\nVariants that are unable to be annotated by Genome Nexus are removed.\nProcessing Transformations\nGenome Nexus Annotation Pipeline\n\u2022 Contributing GENIE centers provided mutation data in Variant Call Format (VCF) or\nMutation Annotation Format (GDC MAF v1.0.0) with additionalfields for read counts\nsupporting variant alleles, reference alleles, and total depth. Some \u201cMAF-like\u201d text files\nwith minimal required columns were also received from the participating centers. These\nvarious input formats were converted into a complete tab-separated MAF format, with\nGenome Nexus.\n\u2022 The GENIE dataset is annotating all variants with Genome Nexus starting from the\n9.1-consortium release (instead of vcf2maf).\nGene symbolharmonization\nAll submitted HUGO gene symbols will be harmonized against GRCh37 by checking the\ncoordinates against the annotation. The below diagram illustrates how conflicts between\nsubmitted and harmonized symbols will be resolved.\n\u2022 Every single row of your bed file will be matched against the gene database. If the\nsubmitted symbol matches a row in the gene database and there is an overlap from the\nsubmitted bed region, the submitted symbol will be returned.\n\u2022 If the submitted symbol does not exist in the database or there is not any overlap, an\nattempt to find any gene that completely encapsulates the submitted bed region is made.\nIf the bed region is contained completely inside one gene, then it is labelled as that gene.\nIf a bed region is enclosed completely in more than one gene, and the submitted symbol\ndoesn\u2019t match any of the genes returned, NULL will be returned.\n\u2022 If the submitted region isn\u2019t enclosed in any gene, then calculations are made to check\nif the bed region resides at least 90% in a gene. If there is more than one gene returned\nwhile doing 90% boundary calculations, NULL is returned.\nCNA Value Harmonization\nOn a per site basis, if there are more two rows that are the same gene, the values are updated\nusing the following logic:\n\u2022 If there is one value, keep that value\n\u2022 If there are two values (e.g. 2 or 0), we take the non-zero value.\n\u2022 If there are two values that aren\u2019t zero (e.g. 1 and 2), it is NA.\n\u2022 If there are more than two values (e.g. 0 or 1 or 2), it is NA.\n8ClinicalTier Release Scope Filters\nSome parts of the clinical data is masked from the public releases. This is based on a clinical\ntier release scope of release document.\nPost-Release Quality Checks\nGENIE-ArtifactFinder\nFinds potential genomic artifacts by filtering unique variants for which counts in a given panel\n>= 10, and counts aggregated from all other panels is < 10 for which there are >= 3 different\npanels that cover the variant in question.\nThe resulting set is annotated with a fisher p-value for the variants that pass this filtering:\nNumber of variants called in panel Number of samples for this panel\nNumber of variants called in other panels with\ncoverage for this variantNumber of samples for panels with\ncoverage for this variant\nRelease Report\nAfter release, each center performs a manual review of their data based on an auto-generated\ndashboard that summarizes some key elements. Some examples of items sites review are given\nbelow:\n\u2022 Confirm sample count\n\u2022 Confirm variant count (flagged mutations). Most of these variants are potential artifacts\nflagged by manual review of cBioPortal. Suggestions for variants that should be part of\nthis list or any variant shouldn\u2019t be part of this list are welcome.\n\u2022 Fix BED and assay information discrepancies\n\u2022 Confirm top 5 most frequently mutated genes per pipeline for all non-synonymous mu-\ntations\n\u2022 Remove blacklisted variants\n\u2022 Confirm clinical attribute distributions/values are valid\n\u2022 Confirm patients and samples that were marked for retraction\nSummary of Sequence Pipeline\nTraditionally, the SEQ_ASSAY_ID was used as an institution\u2019s identifier for their assays\nwhen each assay had one associated gene panel. As GENIE grew, we wanted to support an\nassay having multiple gene panels. SEQ_ASSAY_ID was repurposed to be an identifier for a\n9center\u2019s assay OR panel. For those centers that have multiple panels per assay, we introduced\nSEQ_PIPELINE_ID (pipeline), which encompasses multiple SEQ_ASSAY_ID (panel).\n0.02.55.07.510.012.5\nWAKE\nVICC\nMSK\nCHOP\nUHN\nCOLU\nNKI\nPROV\nDFCI\nDUKE\nMDA\nJHU\nUCHI\nUCSF\nVHIO\nYALE\nCRUK\nGRCC\nSCI\nCenterNumber of Pipelines\n010203040\nHybrid Selection Other

Comprehensive Assay v3\nGenomic Profiling at Each Center\nChilrden\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)\nThe CHOP Comprehensive Solid Tumor Panel and Comprehensive Hematologic Cancer Pane\ninclude sequence and copy number analyses of 238 and 117 cancer genes, respectively, geno-\ntyping of two genes associated with cancer pharmacogenomics, and a Fusion Panel targeting\nover 700 exons of 117 cancer genes.\nNext generation sequencing (NGS) and data analysis: Nucleic acid is extracted from the pa-\ntient\u2019s sample following standard DNA and RNA extraction protocols. Extracted DNA is\nfragmented and tagged using SureSelect QXT target enrichment to generate adapter-tagged\nlibraries. Biotin-labeled probes specific to the targeted regions are used for capture hybridiza-\ntion. Libraries are enriched for the desired regions using streptavidin beads. Enriched libraries\nare then indexed and pooled for sequencing. Libraries are subject to sequence analysis on Il-\nlumina NovaSeq 6000 system for 150 bp paired end reads. All coding exons and the flanking\nintron sequences of targeted genes in the panel are sequenced, and selected promoter regions\n18and known intronic variants are also evaluated. Sequence data are analyzed using the home\nbrew software ConcordS V4.0.0 and NextGENe V2 NGS Analysis Software. Sequence vari-\nants within exons and 5 bp flanking intron sequences are annotated. Copy number variation\n(CNV) analysis for gross deletions and duplications are evaluated using NGS data. RNA se-\nquencing libraries are prepared using Archer Universal RNA Reagent Kit with CHOP fusion\npanel custom-designed primers with target specific molecular barcode. Sequencing data are\nanalyzed using ArcherTM Analysis for fusion genes. Clinically significant variants including\nsingle nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels, CNVs and fusion genes are confirmed by Sanger\nsequencing, MLPA, Real-Time PCR, or ddPCR only when necessary.\nVariant categorization and reporting: Sequence variants, copy number variants, and gene fu-\nsions are evaluated based on the currently available information from relevant resources, such\nas professional guidelines, clinical and population variant databases, tumor specific databases,\nand the scientific literature. Sequence variants are reported according to HGVS nomenclature\n[den Dunnen 2016, PMID: 26931183]. Somatic variants are classified using criteria consistent\nwith those recommended by the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), American So-\nciety of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and College of American Pathologists (CAP) [Li 2017,\nPMID: 27993330], as described below. Tier 1-3 variants are reported. Tier 4 variants are not\nreported.\nTPMT and NUDT15 genotyping: NUDT15 diplotypes 1 through 9, and TPMT diplotypes 1,2,\n3A,3B, and *3C, are assessed [Relling 2019, PMID: 30447069; CPIC Guideline for Thiopurines\nand TPMT and NUDT15].\nHerbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University (COLU)\nColumbia University Irving Medical Center uses the Illumina TruSeq Amplicon \u2013Cancer Panel\n(TSACP) to detect known cancer hotspots.DNA is extracted from unstained sections of FFPE\ntissue paired with an H&E stained section that is used to ensure adequate tumor cellularity\n(human assessment > 30%) and marking of the tumor region of interest (macrodissection).\nExtraction for FFPE tissue is performed on the QiaCube instrument (Qiagen). 50-250ng of\ngenomic DNA is used as input.Tumors are sequenced to an average depth of at least 1000X.\nAlignment (to hg19) and variant calling is performed using NextGENe v2.4.2software. Variants\nlower than 1% allele frequency in all three control populations (White, African American,\nAsian) of the Exome Variant Server database, the 1000 genome project database are retained,\nand annotation of variants is performed using a custom pipeline. All cases are reviewed and\ninterpreted by a molecular pathologist.\nCancer Research UK Cambridge Centre, University of Cambridge (CRUK)\nSequencing data (SNVs/Indels) :\n19DNA was quantified using Qubit HS dsDNA assay (Life Technologies, CA) and libraries were\nprepared from a total of 50 ng of DNA using Illumina\u2019s Nextera Custom Target Enrichment\nkit (Illumina, CA). In brief, a modified Tn5 transposase was used to simultaneously fragment\nDNA and attach a transposon sequence to both end of the fragments generated. This was\nfollowed by a limited cycle PCR amplification (11 cycles) using barcoded oligonucleotides that\nhave primer sites on the transposon sequence generating 96 uniquely barcoded libraries per\nrun. The libraries were then diluted and quantified using Qubit HS dsDNA assay.\nFive hundred nanograms from each library were pooled into a capture pool of 12 samples.\nEnrichment probes (80-mer) were designed and synthesized by Illumina; these probes were\ndesigned to enrich for all exons of the target genes, as well for 500 bp up- and downstream\nof the gene. The capture was performed twice to increase the specificity of the enrichment.\nEnriched libraries were amplified using universal primers in a limited cycle PCR (11 cycles).\nThe quality of the libraries was assessed using Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, CA) and\nquantified using KAPA Library Quantification Kits (Kapa Biosystems, MA).\nProducts from four capture reactions (that is, 48 samples) were pooled for sequencing in a\nlane of Illumina HiSeq 2,000. Sequencing (paired-end, 100 bp) of samples and demultiplexing\nof libraries was performed by Illumina (Great Chesterford, UK).\nThe sequenced reads were aligned with Novoalign, and the resulting BAM files were prepro-\ncessed using the GATK Toolkit. Sequencing quality statistics were obtained using the GATK\u2019s\nDepthOfCoverage tool and Picard\u2019s CalculateHsMetrics. Coverage metrics are presented in\nSupplementary Fig. 1. Samples were excluded if <25% of the targeted bases were covered at\na minimum coverage of 50x.\nThe identities of those samples with copy number array data available were confirmed by\nanalyzing the samples\u2019 genotypes at loci covered by the Affymetrix SNP6 array. Genotype calls\nfrom the sequencing data were compared with those from the SNP6 data that was generated\nfor the original studies. This was to identify possible contamination and sample mix-ups, as\nthis would affect associations with other data sets and clinical parameters.\nTo identify all variants in the samples, we used MuTect (without any filtering) for SNVs and\nthe Haplotype Caller for indels. All reads with a mapping quality <70 were removed prior\nto calling. Variants were annotated with ANNOVAR using the genes\u2019 canonical transcripts\nas defined by Ensembl. Custom scripts were written to identify variants affecting splice sites\nusing exon coordinates provided by Ensembl. Indels were referenced by the first codon they\naffected irrespective of length; for example, insertions of two bases and five bases at the same\ncodon were classed together.\nTo obtain the final set of mutation calls, we used a two-step approach, first removing any\nspurious variant calls arising as a consequence of sequencing artefacts (generic filtering) and\nthen making use of our normal samples and the existing data to identify somatic mutations\n(somatic filtering). For both levels of filtering, we used hard thresholds that were obtained,\nwherever possible, from the data itself. For example, some of our filtering parameters were\nderived from considering mutations in technical replicates (15 samples sequenced in triplicate).\n20We compared the distributions of key parameters (including quality scores, depth, VAF) for\nconcordant (present in all three replicates) and discordant (present in only one out of three\nreplicates) variants to obtain thresholds, and used ROC analysis to select the parameters that\nbest identified concordant variants.\nSNV filtering\n\u2022 Based on our analysis of replicates, SNVs with MuTect quality scores <6.95 were re-\nmoved.\n\u2022 We removed those variants that overlapped with repetitive regions of MUC16 (chromo-\nsome 19: 8,955,441\u20139,044,530). This segment contains multiple tandem repeats (mucin\nrepeats) that are highly susceptible to misalignment due to sequence similarity.\n\u2022 Variants that failed MuTect\u2019s internal filters due to \u2018nearby_gap_events\u2019 and\n\u2018poor_mapping_-regional_alternate_allele_mapq\u2019 were removed.\n\u2022 Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to identify variants exhibiting read direction bias (vari-\nants occurring significantly more frequently in one read direction than in the other;\nFDR=0.0001). These were filtered out from the variant calls.\n\u2022 SNVs present at VAFs smaller than 0.1 or at loci covered by fewer than 10 reads were\nremoved, unless they were also present and confirmed somatic in the Catalogue of So-\nmatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC). The presence of well-known PIK3CA mutations\npresent at low VAFs was confirmed by digital PCR (see below), and supported the use\nof COSMIC when filtering SNVs.\n\u2022 We removed all SNVs that were present in any of the three populations (AMR, ASN,\nAFR) in the 1,000 Genomes study (Phase 1, release 3) with a population alternate allele\nfrequency of >1%.\n\u2022 We used the normal samples in our data set (normal pool) to control for both sequencing\nnoise and germline variants, and removed any SNV observed in the normal pool (at a\nVAF of at least 0.1). However, for SNVs present in more than two breast cancer samples\nin COSMIC, we used more stringent thresholds, removing only those that were observed\nin >5% of normal breast tissue or in >1% of blood samples. The different thresholds\nwere used to avoid the possibility of contamination in the normal pool affecting filtering\nof known somatic mutations. This is analogous to the optional \u2018panel of normals\u2019 filtering\nstep used by MuTect in paired mode, in which mutations present in normal samples are\nremoved unless present in a list of known mutations61.\nIndel filtering\n\u2022 As for SNVs, we removed all indels falling within tandem repeats of MUC16 (coordinates\ngiven above).\n21\u2022 We removed all indels deemed to be of \u2018LowQual\u2019 by the Haplotype Caller with default\nparameters (Phred-scaled confidence threshold=30).\n\u2022 As for SNVs, we removed indels displaying read direction bias. Indels with strand bias\nPhred-scaled scores >40 were removed.\n\u2022 We downloaded the Simple Repeats and Microsatellites tracks from the UCSC Table\nBrowser, and removed all indels overlapping these regions. We also removed all indels\nthat overlapped homopolymer stretches of six or more bases.\n\u2022 As for SNVs, indels were removed if present in the 1,000 Genomes database at an allele\nfrequency >1%, or if they were present in normal samples in our data set. Thresholds\nwere adjusted as for SNVs if the indel was present in COSMIC. The same thresholds for\ndepth and VAF were used.\nMicroarray data (Copy number):\nDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. AS-\nCAT was used to obtain segmented copy number calls and estimates of tumour ploidy and\npurity. Somatic CNAs were obtained by removing germline CNVs as defined in the original\nMETABRIC study3. We defined regions of LOH as those in which there were no copies present\nof either the major or minor allele, irrespective of total copy number. Recurrent CNAs were\nidentified with GISTIC2, with log2 ratios obtained by dividing the total number of copies by\ntumour ploidy for each ASCAT segment. Thresholds for identifying gains and losses were set\nto 0.4 and (-)0.5, respectively; these values were obtained by examining the distribution of\nlog2 ratios to identify peaks associated with copy number states. A broad length cut-off of\n0.98 was used, and peaks were assessed to rule out probe artefacts and CNVs that may have\nbeen originally missed.\nDana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI)\nDFCI uses a custom, hybridization-based capture panel (OncoPanel) to detect single nucleotide\nvariants, small indels, copy number alterations, and structural variants from tumor-only se-\nquencing data. Three (3) versions of the panel have been submitted to GENIE:version 1\ncontaining 275 genes, version 2 containing 300 genes, version 3 containing 447 genes. Speci-\nmens are reviewed by a pathologist to ensure tumor cellularity of at least 20%. Tumors are\nsequenced to an average unique depth of coverage of approximately 200x for version 1 and\n350x for version 2. Reads are aligned using BWA, flagged for duplicate read pairs using Pi-\ncard Tools, and locally realigned using GATK. Sequence mutations are called using MuTect\nfor SNVs and GATK SomaticIndelDetector for small indels. Putative germline variants are\nfiltered out using a panel of historical normals or if present in ESP at a frequency \u2265.1%, unless\nthe variant is also present in COSMIC. Copy number alterations are called using a custom\npipeline and reported for fold-change >1. Structural rearrangements are called using BreaK-\nmer. Testing is performed for all patients across all solid tumor types. Version 3 includes the\n22exonicregions of 447 genes and 191 intronic regions across 60 genes targeted for rearrangement\ndetection. 52 genes present in previous versions were retired in the v3 test.\nDuke Cancer Institute (DUKE)\nFoundation medicine panels: Duke uses Illumina hybridization-based capture panels from\nFoundation Medicine to detect single nucleotide variants, small indels, copy number alterations\nand structural variants from FFPE, tumor-only sequencing data. Three gene panels were\nused: Panel 1 (T5a bait set), covering 326 genes, Panel 2 (T7 bait set), covering 434 genes,\nand Panel 3 (DX1 bait set), covering 324 genes. The clinical sequencing data were analyzed\nby Foundation Medicine-developed pipelines. Briefly: A pool of 5\u2019-biotinylated DNA 120bp\noligonucleotides were designed as baits with 60bp overlap in targeted exon regions and 20bp\noverlap in targeted introns with a minimum of 3 baits per target and 1 bait per SNP target.\nThe goal was a depth of sequencing between 750x and 1000x. Mapping to the reference\ngenome was accomplished using BWA, local alignment optimizations with GATK, and PCR\nduplicate read removal and sequence metric collection with Picard and Samtools. A Bayesian\nmethodology incorporating tissue-specific prior expectations allowed for detection of novel\nsomatic mutations at low MAF and increased sensitivity at hotspots. Final single nucleotide\nvariant (SNV) calls were made at MAF \u22655% (MAF \u22651% at hotspots) with filtering for\nstrand bias, read location bias and presence of two or more normal controls. Indels were\ndetected using the deBrujn approach of de novo local assembly within each targeted exon\nand through direct read alignment and then filtered as described for SNVs. Copy number\nalterations were detected utilizing a comparative genomic hybridization-like method to obtain\na log-ratio profile of the sample to estimate tumor purity and copy number. Absolute copy\nnumber was assigned to segments based on Gibbs sampling. To detect gene fusions, chimeric\nread pairs were clustered by genomic coordinates and clusters containing at least 10 chimeric\npairs were identified as rearrangement candidates.\nInstitut Gustave Roussy (GRCC)\nGustave Roussy Cancer Centre submitted data includes somatic variants (single nucleotide\nvariants and small indels) identified with CancerHotspot Panel v2 from tumor-only sequence\ndata. Several versions of the panel have been used: CHP2 covering hotspots in 50 genes,\nMOSC3 covering hotspots in 74 genes and MOSC4 covering 89 genes. Tumors are sequenced\nto an average unique depth of coverage of >500X. The sequencing data were analyzed with the\nTorrent SuiteTMVariant Caller 4.2 and higher and reported somatic variants were compared\nwith the reference genome GRCh37 (hg19). The variants were called if >5 reads supported\nthe variant and/or total base depth >50 and/or variant allele frequency >1% was observed.\nAll the variants identified were visually controlled on .bam files using Alamut v2.4.2 software\n(Interactive Biosoftware). All the germline variants found in 1000 Genomes Project or ESP\n23(Exome Sequencing Project database) with frequency >0.1% were removed. All somatic mu-\ntations were annotated, sorted, and interpreted by an expert molecular biologist according to\navailable databases (COSMIC, TCGA) and medical literature.\nThe submitted data set was obtained from selected patients that were included in the\nMOSCATO trial (Molecular Screening for CAncer Treatment Optimization) (NCT01566019).\nThis trial collected on-purpose tumour samples (from the primary or from a metastatic\nsite) that are immediately fresh-frozen, and subsequently analyzed for targeted gene panel\nsequencing. Tumour cellularity was assessed by a senior pathologist on a haematoxylin and\neosin slide from the same biopsy core to ensure tumor cellularity of at least 10%.\nJohns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (JHU)\nJohns Hopkins submitted genomic data from the Ion AmpliSeqCancer Hotspot Panel v2, which\ndetects mutations in cancer hotspots from tumor-only analysis. Data from the JHU_50GP_V2\npanel covering frequently mutated regions in 50 genes was submitted to GENIE. Pathologist in-\nspection of an H&E section ensured adequatetumor cellularity (approximately 10% or greater).\nDNA was extracted from the macro-dissected FFPE tumor region of interest. Tumors are se-\nquenced to an average unique read depth of coverage of greater than 500X. For alignment the\nTMAP aligner developed by Life Technology for the Ion Torrent sequencing platform is used to\nalign to hg19/GRCh37 using the manufacturer\u2019s suggested settings. Tumor variants are called\nwith a variety of tools. Samtools mpileup is run on the aligned .bam file and then processed\nwithcustom perl scripts (via a naive variant caller) to identify SNV and INS/DEL. Specimen\nvariant filters have a total read depth filter of \u2265100, a variant allele coverage of \u226510, variant\nallele frequency for substitutions \u22650.05, variant allele frequency for small (less than 50 base\npair) insertions or deletions \u22650.05, and \u201cstrand bias\u201d of total reads and of variant alleles\nare both less than 2-fold when comparing forward and reverse reads. Additionally, variants\nseen in greater than 20% of a set of non-neoplastic control tissues (>3 of 16 samples) with\nthe same filter criteria are excluded. Finally, variants documented as \u201ccommon\u201d in dbSNP\nand not known to COSMIC are excluded. The cohort includes both primary and metastatic\nlesions and some repeated sampling of the same patient.\nThe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDA)\nThe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center submitted data in the current data set\nincludes sequence variants (small indels and point mutations) identified using an amplicon-\nbased targeted hotspot tumor-only assay, and sequence variants/gene level amplifications\nidentified on anamplicon-based exonic gene panel which incorporates germline variant sub-\ntraction (MDA-409). Two different amplicon pools and pipeline versions are included for the\nhotspot tumor-only assays: a 46-gene assay (MDA-46) corresponding to customized version\nof AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel, v1 (Life Technologies), and a 50-gene assay (MDA-50)\ncorresponding to the AmpliSeq Hotspot Panel v2. The exonic assay with germline variant\n24subtraction and amplification detection corresponds to the AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer\nPanel. DNA wasextracted from unstained sections of tissue paired with astained section that\nwas used to ensure adequate tumor cellularity (human assessment > 20%) and marking of\nthe tumor region of interest (macrodissection). Sequencing was performed on an Ion Torrent\nPGM (hotspot) or Proton (exonic). Tumors were sequenced to a minimum depth of coverage\n(per amplicon) of approximately 250X. Bioinformatics pipeline for MDA-46 was executed using\nTorrentSuite 2.0.1 signal processing, basecalling, alignment and variant calling. For MDA-50,\nTorrentSuite 3.6 was used. Initial calls were made by Torrent Variant Caller (TVC) using\nlow-stringency somatic parameters. For MDA-50, TorrentSuite 3.6 was used. For MDA-409,\nTorrentSuite 4.4 was used. For MDA-409, TorrentSuite 4.4 was used. Initial calls were made\nby Torrent Variant Caller (TVC) using low-stringency somatic parameters. All called vari-\nants were parsed into a custom annotation & reporting system, OncoSeek, with a back-end\nSQL Server database using a convergent data model for all sequencing platforms used by the\nlaboratory. Calls were reviewed with initial low stringency to help ensure that low effective\ntumor cellularity samples do not get reported as false negative samples. Nominal variant filters\n(5% variantallelic frequency minimum, 25 variant coverage minimum, variant not present in\npaired germline DNA for the exonic assay) can then be applied dynamically. Clinical sequenc-\ning reports were generated using OncoSeek to transform genomic representations into HGVS\nnomenclature. To create VCF files for this project, unfiltered low stringency VCF files were\ncomputationally cross checked against a regular expressions-based variant extract from clinical\nreports. Only cases where all extracted variants from the clinical report were deterministically\nmappable to the unfiltered VCF file and corresponding genomic coordinates were marked for\ninclusion in this dataset. This method filters a small number of cases where complex indels may\nnot have originally been called correctly at the VCF level. Testing is performed for patients\nwith advanced metastatic cancer across all solid tumor types.\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK)\nMSK uses a custom, hybridization-based capture panel (MSK-IMPACT) to detect single nu-\ncleotide variants, small indels, copy number alterations, and structural variants from matched\ntumor-normal sequence data (a pool of normals is used for a small subset of samples with a\nmissing normal). Three (3) versions of the panel have been submitted to GENIE: version 1\ncontaining 341 genes, version 2 containing 410 genes, version 3 containing 468 genes. Speci-\nmens are reviewed by a pathologist to ensure tumor cellularity of at least 10%. Tumors are\nsequenced to an average unique depth of coverage of approximately 750X. Reads are aligned\nusing BWA, flagged for duplicate read pairs using GATK, and locally realigned using ABRA.\nSequence mutations are called using MuTect, VarDict, and Somatic indel detector, and re-\nported for >5% allele frequency (novel variants) or >2% allele frequency (recurrent hotspots).\nCopy number alterations are called using a custom pipeline and reported for fold-change >2.\nStructural rearrangements are called using Delly. All somatic mutations are reported with-\nout regard to biological function. Testing is performed for patients with advanced metastatic\ncancer across all solid tumor types.\n25Netherlands Cancer Center, The Netherlands (NKI)\nNKI uses Illumina TruSeq Amplicon \u2013Cancer Panel (TSACP) to detect known cancer hotspots\nfrom tumor-only sequencing data. A single gene panel, NKI-TSACP covering known hotspots\nin 48 genes with 212 amplicons has been used. Specimens are reviewed by a pathologist to\nensure tumor cellularity of at least 10%. Tumors are sequenced to an average unique depth\nof coverage of approximately 4000x. The sample plate and sample sheet are made using the\nIllumina Experiment Manager software before running the sample on the MiSeq Sequencing\nSystem (Illumina, SY-410-1003) and MiSeq Reporter (v2.5) is used for data analysis. Reads are\naligned using Banded Smith Waterman (v2.5.1.3), and samtools isused to further sort and index\nthe BAM files. Variant calling is performed via the Illumina somatic variant caller (v3.5.2.1).\nFurther detailed variant analysis (e.g. removal of known artifacts, known benign SNPs and\nvariants with read depth < 200 or VAF < 0.05 and manual classification) is performed via\nCartagenia BenchLab (https://cartagenia.com/). Testing is performed for all patients across\nall solid tumor types.\nProvidence Health & Services Cancer Institute (PROV)\nPROV has submitted data from two assays: PROV-focus-v1 and PROV-triseq-v1. For the\nPROV-focus-v1 we have employed the Thermo Fisher Oncomine Focus Assay for amplification\nof 52 genes from DNA extracted from macro-dissected FFPE samples taken from Pathologist\nspecified tumor regionsof interest (ROIs), with 20% minimal tumor cellularity. Samples include\nprimary and metastatic tumor ROIs. The assay is a tumor only assay, no paired \u201cnormal\u201d\nDNA is extracted from each case.\nThe PROV-focus-v1 BED file describes the positions of the genome assayed by the PROV-\nfocus-v1 panel relative to hg19.\nAmplification products are sequenced on the Life Technology Ion Torrent platform to an\naverage read depth of coverage greater than 500X average per base coverage.\nThe TMAP aligner developed by Life Technology for the ION torrent sequencing platform was\nused to align reads to hg19 using the manufacture suggested settings. Variants are called with\nthe Torrent Suite Variant Caller 4.2 software plug-in.\nVariant filters requiring a total read depth of greater than 100X, variant allele coverage of\ngreater than 10X, and a variant allele frequency for substitutions of greater than or equal to\n0.03 are applied. Also, the specimen variant must not be annotated as \u201cCOMMON\u201d (a variant\nallele frequency for substitutions of \u22650.05) in dnSNP. VCF files were created for upload to\nGENIE 6.1 by further filtering all detected variants to only those reported after expert review\nby clinicians.\nFor the PROV-triseq-v1 we used DNA extracted from macro-dissected FFPE samples taken\nfrom Pathologist specified tumor regions of interest (ROIs), with 20% minimal tumor cellularity\n26for extraction of tumor DNA, and whole peripheral blood for extraction of normal DNA. Tumor\nsamples include both primary and metastatic tumor ROIs.\nThe PROV-triseq-v1 BED file describes the positions of the genome assayed by the PROV-\ntriseq-v1 panel relative to hg19.\nLibraries are prepared using the KAPA for Illumina reagents protocols. Indexed libraries are\npooled for exome capture on the xGen V1.0 panel (https://www.idtdna.com/). Sequencing is\nperformed on Illumina 2500, 4000, or Novaseq platforms.\nRaw sequencing data in the form of BCL files are uploaded to the Providence secure computing\ncloud environment maintained by Amazon Web Services. Following upload, raw files are\nconverted to unaligned reads in FASTQ format using the software program bcl2fastq2, and\nresultant FASTQ files are aligned to the hg19 human reference genome using the Burrows-\nWheeler Aligner (BWA). Aligned reads in the SAM format are subsequently converted to\nbinary BAM format using the samtools software package, and aligned reads are processed for\nsingle-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions and deletions (indels) using our custom\nvariant calling pipeline (see below). FASTQ and aligned BAM files are analyzed with FastQC\nand Picard metrics for Molecular Genomics Lab staff run-level and sample-level review.\nThe Providence variant calling pipeline includes multiple variant calling algorithms including\nVarScan2, SomaticSniper, Mutect2 and Strelka. Variant filters requiring a total read depth of\ngreater than 100X, variant allele coverage of greater than 10X, and a variant allele frequency\nfor substitutions of greater than or equal to 0.03 are applied. Calls with low-quality variants,\nsilent mutations, and germline variants are also filtered. Annotations from SnpEff, ClinVar,\nExAC, 1000 Genomes, ANNOVAR, and COSMIC are incorporated for each call. Finally, all\ncommon variants, with non-zero allele frequencies the ExAC or 1000 Genomes databases, are\nremoved.\nGENIE 6.1 VCF files containing annotated calls from Mutect2 were created for upload to\nGENIE 6.1.\nSwedish Cancer Institute (SCI)\nSCI uses CellNetixPMP gene panel to detect hotspot mutations in known cancer genes from\nsolid tumor DNA (Formalin-fixed, para\ufb00in-embedded tissue). The hotspot gene panel covers\n68 genes. Tumor cell content is greater than 10% verified by pathologist. Tumor DNA is\nsequenced to >200x on average (Variant that allele frequency is less than 10% requires more\nthan 400X) on Illumina MiSeq (TruSeq Amplicon) platform, and data is analyzed in MiSeq\nReporter 2.5. Reads are aligned to hg19 reference genome by the BWA (v0.6.1-r104-tpx) aligner\nadapted by the MiSeq Reporter Software (v2.4.1 or v2.5) using the manufacture suggested\nsettings. MiSeq Reporter provided Somatic Variant Caller (v2.1.12) is run on the aligned\n.bam files to identify variants present in DNA samples. Detailed stepsplease refer toIllumina\nMiSeq Reporter User Guide. Variants are filtered for allele frequency greater than 3% except\n27for actionable mutations. Variants that are observed in \u226575% samples on the same run, or\ncommon variant with population frequency of > 50%, or average population frequency >5%\nreported in the 1000 genome and/or in ExAc. are filtered.\nThe University of Chicago (UCHI)\nNot Available\nUniversity of California-San Francisco (UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer\nCenter) (UCSF)\nUCSF uses a custom, hybridization-based capture panel (UCSF500) to detect single nucleotide\nvariants, small indels, copy number alterations, and structural variants from both matched\ntumor-normal and tumor-only specimens. Two versions of the panel have been submitted to\nGENIE: UCSF-NIMV4 consists of 481 genes and includes coverage of select promoter regions\n(TERT and SDHD) as well as the intronic or UTR regions of 47 genes for the detection of\nstructural rearrangements. UCSF-IDTV5 consists of 529 genes, retains TERT and SDHD\npromoter coverage, and expands intronic or UTR region coverage to 73 genes for the detection\nof structural rearrangements. Testing is performed for patients with solid or hematological\nmalignancies. Specimens are reviewed by a pathologist to ensure tumor cellularity of greater\nthan 25%. Tumor DNA is extracted from sections of FFPE tissue; for uveal melanoma cases,\nfrozen fresh fine needle aspirates are accepted. Normal DNA can be extracted from peripheral\nblood draw, buccal swab, or micro-dissected non-lesional areas. Hybridization capture is\nperformed with SeqCap EZ target enrichment kit; sequencing platform is the HiSeq2500 prior\nto October 2020, and NovaSeq6000 after. Tumors are sequenced to an average unique depth\nof coverage of approximately >500X. FASTQC is run on unaligned sequencing reads to collect\nread-level summary statistics for downstream quality control; additionally, a suite of Picard\ntools are also run to assess quality metrics from sequencing runs. BWA-MEM aligner is used\nto align sequencing reads from each sample to the reference genome (hg19). The following\nbioinformatic workflows are used for variant calling:\nSNV callers\n\u2022 Tumor sample: FreeBayes, GATK UnifiedGenotyper, Pindel Normal sample: FreeBayes,\nGATK HaplotypeCaller, Pindel\n\u2022 Matched pairs: FreeBayes, Mutect, GATK SomaticIndelDetector\nStructural variant callers\n\u2022 DELLY\n\u2022 Pindel calls larger than 100bp are treated as structural variants\n28Copy Number Calls\n\u2022 CNVkit using a reference profile for normalization of approximately 30 pooled normal\nsamples\nVariants are removed if present with frequency \u22651% in ESP6500, 1000 Genomes, or ExAC\ndatasets. Known sequencing artifacts are removed. Variants with < 50x total coverage in the\ntumor sample are removed.\nPrincess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN)\nPrincess Margaret Cancer Centre used three (6) panels to sequence samples - UHN-48-V1,\nUHN-50-V2, UHN-54-V1, UHN-555-V1, UHN-555-V2 and UHN-OCAv3. Each panel is de-\nscribed below:\nIllumina TruSeq Amplicon panel (UHN-48-V1): Princess Margaret Cancer Centre used the\nTruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel (TSACP, Illumina) to detect single nucleotide variants and\nsmall indels from matched tumor-normal sequencing data. Specimens are reviewed by a pathol-\nogist to ensure tumor cellularity of at least 20%. Tumors are sequenced to an average unique\ndepth of coverage of approximately 500x and normal blood samples to 100x.

Sequence\nmutations (SNV and indel) were called using Varscan (v2.3.8). Results were filtered to\nkeep only those with tumor variant allele frequency of at least 10%.\nThermoFisher Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel (UHN-50-V2): Princess Margaret Cancer Cen-\ntre also used the TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel (TSACP, Illumina) to detect single nu-\ncleotide variants and small indels from matched tumor-normal sequencing data. Specimens\nwere reviewed by a pathologist to ensure tumor cellularity of at least 20%. Tumors were\nsequenced to an average unique depth of coverage of approximately 500x and normal blood\n29samples to 100x. Ion Torrent data was converted to fastq and sequences were aligned us-\ning NextGENe Software v2.3.1. NextGENe Software v2.3.1 provides a version of hg19 (Hu-\nman_v37_3_dbsnp_135_dna). NextGENe was used to call SNV and indels. Results were\nthen filtered to keep all with VAF of at least 10% and total coverage of at least 100x.\nIllumina TruSeq Myeloid Sequencing Panel (UHN-54-V1): Princess Margaret Cancer Centre\nalso used the TruSeq Myeloid Sequencing Panel (Illumina) to detect single nucleotide variants\nand small indels in DNA from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from patients with\nacute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myeloproliferative neoplasms. The diagnosis\nof each patient was confirmed by hematopathologist using the 2016 revision of the World\nHealth Organization classification system for myeloid neoplasms. Tumors were sequenced to\nan average unique depth of coverage of approximately 500x. MiSeq fastq were aligned using\n(MiSeq Reporter v2.4.60 and the corresponding default version of hg19).

NextSeq fastq were aligned using bwa-mem\nand the BAMs were processed using GATK best practices. Variants were called using VarScan\nv2.3.8. VCF files were filtered to remove known artifacts. Variants that are not on a manually\ncurated list of hotspots that have depth less than 50, or if depth 50 to 100 with frequency\n<10%, or if depth was at least 100 with frequency <5%, were removed.\nIon Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3 (UHN-OCAv3): Princess Margaret Cancer Centre\nused the Thermofisher Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3 to detect relevant single nucleotide\nvariants, small indels, copy number changes and gene fusions. Genomic DNA and RNA\nwere co-isolated and then sequencing was performed on the Ion S5 XL System. Variant calls\nwere generated using Torrent Browser 5.12 (ThermoFisher) with alignment to genome build\nGRCh37/hg19. Filtering of reportable variants uses the Oncomine Variant Annotator plugin\nto annotate variants in Ion Reporter 5.12, with variant criteria and thresholds as supplied.\nThe reportable range is 5%-100% variant allele frequency. Minimum acceptable coverage for\nall reported genomic regions is >200x. Copy number gains and losses are assessed using the\nOncomine Variant Annotator plugin, with thresholds of <0.5 or >4 copies reported. Gene\nfusions are assessed using the Oncomine Variant Annotator plugin, with variant criteria and\nthresholds as supplied (quality threshold of >500,000 reads reported as \u2018pass\u2019 for gene fusion\nsequencing). The assay detects recurrent and novel gene partners with expressed gene fusions\nof the genes listed and minimum acceptable read count for all reported fusions is >2000.\n30Vall d\u2019Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO)\nVall d\u2019Hebron institute of Oncology (VHIO) submitted data that includes somatic variants\n(single nucleotide variants and small indels) identified with VHIO Card Amplicon panels that\ntarget frequently mutated regions in oncogenes and tumor suppressors. A total of fifteen panels\nhave been submitted taking different tumor types into consideration. The panels are:\n\u2022 VHIO-GENERAL-V01: Panel containing 56 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes\n\u2022 VHIO-BRAIN-V01 (General + NF1 v1: 57 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-BILIARY-V01 (General + *FGFR v1 + **NOTCH v1: 59 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-COLORECTAL-V01 (General + RingFingers v1 + **NOTCH v1: 60 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-HEAD-NECK-V1 (General + MTOR v1 + **NOTCH v1: 61 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-ENDOMETRIUM-V01 (General + RingFingers v1 + *FGFR v1 + NF1 v1: 60\ngenes)\n\u2022 VHIO-GASTRIC-V01 (General + RingFingers v1 + MTOR v1 + **NOTCH v1: 63\ngenes)\n\u2022 VHIO-PAROTIDE-V01 (General + **NOTCH v1: 58 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-BREAST-V01 (General + *FGFR v1 + **NOTCH v1+ GATA3 v1: 60 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-OVARY-V01 (General + BRCA v1: 58 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-PANCREAS-V01 (General + Ring Fingers v1 + BRCA v1: 60 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-SKIN-V01 (General + NF1 v1 + MTOR v1: 60 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-LUNG-V01 (General + NF1 v1 + MET v1 + FGFRw7 v1: 58 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-KIDNEY-V01 (General + MTOR v1: 59 genes)\n\u2022 VHIO-URINARY-BLADDER-V01 (General + *FGFR v1 + NF1 v1 + MTOR v1: 61\ngenes)\n*FGFRv1 panel includes extra regions in FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes. **NOTCHv1\npanel includes extra regions in FBXW7 and NOTCH1 genes. FGFRw7 v1 panel includes extra\nregions in FGFR1 gene. MET v1 panel includes intronic regions flanking Exon 14 of MET\ngene.\nTumor samples are reviewed by a pathologist to ensure tumor cellularity of at least 20%.\nFor the sample loading into tumor-specific panels, we use a FREEDOM EVO 150 Platform\nfrom TECAN. Tumors are sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq instrument, to an average depth of\ncoverage of approximately 1000X. Samples are sequenced, and two independent chemistries are\nperformed and sequenced. Sequencing reads are aligned (BWA v0.7.17, Samtools v1.9), base\nrecalibrated, Indel realigned (GATK v3.7.0), and variant called (VarScan2 v2.4.3). A minimum\n31of 7 reads supporting the variant allele is required in order to call a mutation. Frequent\nSNPs in the population are filtered with the 1000g database (MAF>0.005). The average\nnumber of reads representing a given nucleotide in the panel (Sample Average Coverage) is\ncalculated. Manual curation of variants is performed after manual search of available literature\nand databases, in terms of their clinical significance.\n\u2022 VHIO-300 panel\nDNA from tumor-FFPE sample was obtained (Maxwell\u00ae RSC FFPE Plus DNA Kit\n(Promega)) and a custom gene capture approach (see below) performed (enrichment probes:\nSureSelect XT, Agilent). The resulting library was sequenced using the Illumina sequencing\nby synthesis (SBS) technology (2 x 100 PE run).\nSequencing reads were aligned (BWA v0.7.17, Samtools v1.9) against the hg19 reference\ngenome, base recalibrated, indel realigned (GATK v3.7.0, abra2 v2.23) and variant called\n(VarScan2 v2.4.3, Mutect2 v4.1.0.0). Variants from both callers are reported. A minimum\nof 5 reads supporting the variant allele were required to call a mutation. The sensitivity of\nthe technique is 5% MAF for SNVs and 10% MAF for INDELs. Frequent single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) in the population were filtered based on the gnomAD database (allele\nfrequency \u0e00 0.0001) and copy number alterations (CNA) were calculated (CN- Vkit v0.9.6.dev0).\nVariants were manually curated and classification of identified variants was performed using\npublicly available databases (COSMIC, cBioPortal, ClinVar, VarSome, OncoKB).\nVanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC)\nFoundation medicine panels: VICC uses Illumina hybridization-based capture panels from\nFoundation Medicine to detect single nucleotide variants, small indels, copy number alterations\nand structural variants from tumor-only sequencing data. Two gene panels were used: Panel\n1 (T5a bait set), covering 326 genes and; and Panel 2 (T7 bait set), covering 434 genes. DNA\nwas extracted from unstained FFPE sections, and H&E stained sections were used to ensure\nnucleated cellularity \u226580% and tumor cellularity \u226520%, with use of macro-dissection to enrich\nsamples with \u226420% tumor content. A pool of 5\u2019-biotinylated DNA 120bp oligonucleotides\nwere designed as baits with 60bp overlap in targeted exon regions and 20bp overlap in targeted\nintrons with a minimum of 3 baits per target and 1 bait per SNP target. The goal was a depth\nof sequencing between 750x and 1000x. Mapping to the reference genome was accomplished\nusing BWA, local alignment optimizations with GATK, and PCR duplicate read removal and\nsequence metric collection with Picard and Samtools. A Bayesian methodology incorporating\ntissue-specific prior expectations allowed for detection of novel somatic mutations at low MAF\nand increased sensitivity at hotspots. Final single nucleotide variant (SNV) calls were made\nat MAF \u22655% (MAF \u22651% at hotspots) with filtering for strand bias, read location bias and\npresence of two or more normal controls. Indels were detected using the deBrujn approach of\nde novo local assembly within each targeted exon and through direct read alignment and then\nfiltered as described for SNVs. Copy number alterations were detected utilizing a comparative\n32genomic hybridization-like method to obtain a log-ratio profile of the sample to estimate tumor\npurity and copy number. Absolute copy number was assigned to segments based on Gibbs\nsampling. To detect gene fusions, chimeric read pairs were clustered by genomic coordinates\nand clusters containing at least 10 chimeric pairs were identified as rearrangement candidates.\nRare tumors and metastatic samples were prioritized for sequencing, but ultimately sequencing\nwas at the clinician\u2019s discretion.\nVICC also submitted data from 2 smaller hotspot amplicon panels, one used for all myeloid\n(VICC-01-myeloid) tumors and 1 used for some solid tumors (VICC-01-solidtumor). These\npanels detect point mutations and small indels from 37 and 31 genes, respectively. Solid\ntumor H&E were inspected to ensure adequate tumor cellularity (>10%). Sections were\nmacrodissected if necessary, and DNA was extracted. Tumors were sequenced to an aver-\nage depth greater than 1000X. Reads were aligned to hg19/GRCh37 with novoalign, and\nsingle nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions greater than 5% were called utilizing a cus-\ntomized bioinformatic pipeline. Large (15bp and greater) FLT3 insertions were called using a\nspecialized protocol and were detected to a 0.5% allelic burden.\nWake Forest University Health Sciences, Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center (WAKE)\nWe utilized thesequencing analysis pipelines from Foundation Medicine and Caristo analyze\nclinical samples and support.Enrichment of target sequences was achieved by solution-based\nhybrid capture with custom biotinylated oligonucleotide bases. Enriched libraries were se-\nquenced to an average median depth of >500\u00d7 with 99% of bases covered >100\u00d7 (Illumi-\nnaHiSeq2000 platform using 49 \u00d7 49 paired-end reads).The clinical sequencing data were\nanalyzed by Foundation Medicine and Carisdevelopedpipelines.Sequenced readswere mapped\nto the reference human genome (hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner and the publicly\navailable SAM tools, Picard, and Genome Analysis Toolkit. Point mutations were identified\nby a Bayesian algorithm; short insertions and deletions determined by local assembly; gene\ncopy numberalterations identified by comparison to process-matched normal controls; and\ngene fusions/rearrangements determined by clustering chimeric reads mapped to targeted in-\ntrons.Following by computational analysis with tools such asMutSigand CHASM, the driver\nmutations can be identified which may help the selection of treatment strategy. In addition,\nthe initial report of the analysis of 470 cases has been published and highlightedon the cover\nof the journalTheranosticsin 2017.\nYale University, Yale Cancer Center (YALE)\nGENIE samples submitted by Yale belong to one of three targeted NGS panels (1) YALE-\nHSM-V1, (2) YALE-OCP-V2, or (3) YALE-OCP-V3. The first panel corresponds to the\nThermofisher Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2, which is designed to assess hotspot vari-\nants in 50 of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer, and is performed as a tumor-only\n33analysis. The latter two panels refer to v2 and v3C of the Thermofisher Oncomine Comprehen-\nsive Assay, which provides a more comprehensive assessment of somatic alterations including\nsingle nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions, copy number alterations (CNAs), and gene\nfusions across 143 and 161 genes, respectively. Target region design (i.e. full exonic, hotspot\nonly, intronic, promoter) varies based on known relevance of each gene. Pathologist inspection\nof an H&E section ensured adequate tumor cellularity (approximately 10% or greater). Tumor\nsamples are enriched for malignant cells by manual microdissection of unstained formalin-fixed,\npara\ufb00in-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. If available, germline control DNA from the same\npatient is obtained either from FFPE non-tumor tissue, from the patient\u2019s blood, or from\na buccal swab. Subsequent libraries are barcoded and sequenced on either an Ion Torrent\nPGM\u2122 or an Ion S5\u2122 XL next generation sequencer.\nPre-processing and alignment of reads is performed within Torrent Suite, with TMAP serving\nas the alignment algorithm. Resulting BAM files are uploaded to the Ion Reporter software\nfor variant detection, as well as CNA and gene fusion assessment for Oncomine samples. The\nbioinformatics pipeline also uses MuTect2 (GATK) and Strelka (Illumina) to assess somatic\nvariants. Variants are initially filtered based on quality metrics; a minimum read depth of 20x\nand avariant allelic fraction (VAF) of 0.02 is required. All variants passing quality filters are\npassed through the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor for variant annotation. Variants that\nare intronic or synonymous are filtered at this stage; all other variants are manually reviewed\nfor accuracy before submission to the attending pathologist. Variants below a VAF below\n0.05 are not typically reviewed unless tumor cellularity estimates are low. CNA assessment is\nperformed using the IonReporter CNV algorithm,as well as an internally developed workflow\nthat uses the DNAcopy R package. Custom visualizations for amplified genes are used to\nconfirm accuracy of CNAs reported by the pipeline. Only CNAs with a ploidy of 5 or higher\nare reported. Gene fusion assessment is handled by a custom workflow in the Ion Reporter\nsoftware which aligns cDNA reads to known fusion breakpoints. A fusion read is mapped\nsuccessfully if there is an overlap of 70% and exact matches of 66.66%.\nDescription of Data Files\nDescription on most of the data files can be found in the cBioPortal file formats docs.\ndata_mutations_extended.txt\n\u2022 Description: The mutation data file extends the Mutation Annotation Format (MAF)\ncreated as part of the Cancer Genome Atlas project, by adding extra annotations to each\nmutation record.\n\u2022 Details: MAF format\ndata_clinical_patient.txt/data_clinical_sample.txt\n34\u2022 Description: The clinical data is used to capture both clinical attributes and the mapping\nbetween patient and sample IDs.\n\u2022 Details: Clinical format\ndata_CNA.txt\n\u2022 Description: The copy number data file contain values that would be derived from copy-\nnumber analysis algorithms like GISTIC or RAE.

            "summary": "The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Project GENIE (Genomics, Evidence, Neoplasia, Information, Exchange) is an international data-sharing initiative aimed at advancing precision cancer medicine. The project aggregates, harmonizes, and links clinical-grade, next-generation cancer genomic sequencing data with clinical outcomes to improve clinical decision-making and benefit the global cancer research community. The data is publicly accessible and is intended to provide the statistical power necessary to improve clinical decision-making, identify novel therapeutic targets, understand patient response to therapy, and design new biomarker-driven clinical trials. The project also serves as a prototype for aggregating, harmonizing, and sharing clinical-grade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data obtained during routine medical practice. The database currently contains CLIA-/ISO-certified genomic data obtained during the course of routine practice at multiple international institutions and will continue to grow as more patients are treated at additional participating centers. The data within GENIE is shared with the global research community and is available via the Synapse Platform (Sage Bionetworks) and cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (MSK). The data includes clinical patient and sample data, variant data (MAF or VCF file), assay information, and genomic regions data (BED file). Optional files include structural variant data, segmented data, discrete copy number data, mutations in cis data, and sample and/or patient retraction files. The data undergoes a rigorous validation process to ensure quality and consistency. Specific sample and variant filters and transformations are applied during processing, and the release files go through manual and automated review processes. The clinical data includes attributes such as age at sequencing report, center submitting the data, ethnicity, OncoTree code for primary cancer diagnosis, patient ID, primary race, sample ID, sample type, detailed sample type, sequencing assay ID, sex, cancer type, detailed cancer type, year of last contact, year of death, interval from date of birth to last contact, interval from date of birth to date of death, and whether the patient is deceased. The genomic data includes single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small indels, copy number alterations (CNAs), and structural variants. The data is annotated using Genome Nexus and harmonized against GRCh37. The project includes data from multiple international institutions, each with its own sequencing and data processing protocols. The data is de-identified to protect patient privacy, and users must agree to terms of use that prohibit attempts to identify or contact individual participants and redistribution of the data without express written permission from the AACR Project GENIE Coordinating Center. The data is intended for use by the global research community to advance precision cancer medicine and improve patient outcomes."

Based on the outcomes from the initial five years of \nresearch funding , an additional  program was launched in August of 2011 entitled  \u201cThe Clinical \nProteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium \u201d, or CPTAC .  CPTAC is a comprehensive and \ncoordinated effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the \napplication of robust,  quantitative, proteomic technologies and workflows.  \nThe participating proteome research groups  in CPTAC  recognized the need for a Common \nData Analysis Pipeline  (CDAP)  in order to remove the multiple sources of variability that would \nresult when trying to compare peptides and proteins inferred by each group  using different \nsoftware .  This overview , for non -proteomic researchers,  explains why and how processing \nchoices produce results that appear to differ both qualitatively and quantitatively.   If you alrea dy \nunderstand the elements of peptide and proteomic analyses using mass spectrometry, you might \nskip this document and proceed to use \u201cA Description of the CPTAC Comm on Data Analysis \nPipeline (CDAP) .\u201d  That document details  stepwise the software programs and output files of the  \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline run at NIST . \nProteomics in a Nutshell  \n{ Note to the reader: If you are completely unfamiliar with proteomics, we suggest reading \n\u201cWhat Is Proteomics \u201d.  There are also numerous reviews which are indexed at PubMed.  \n \nIf you are somewhat familiar with proteomics or are coming at this document from a related \nbackground (e.g., genomics), the following is a brief description and analogy as a refresher. } \n \nTissue samples are digested enzymatically to break large proteins into small segments \n(peptides containing 7 -30 am ino acids) that are amenable to automated analysis and assignment Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n4 \n of their amino acid sequences. The digests contain tens of thousands of peptides .  Each \ntryptically digested tumor sample  mixture is separated  using multiple stages of chromatography \nto allo w more effective mass spectrometric analyses of less complex mixtures.  Typically, a \npatient tumor  sample  digest  was chromatographically separated  into 24 fractions, each of which \nwas analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography  (LC)  coupled to a high -resolution \ntandem mass spectrometer  (MS/MS) .  Once introduced into the mass spectrometer, a small mass \nregion ( containing  1 or a few peptides) is fragmented to produce a sequencing mass ladder where \neach peak in the spectrum ( graph displ aying m/z vs. relative intensity data ) corresponds to a sub -\npeptide, fragmented with missing residues from one end or the other.  It is these mass ladders \nthat are analyzed by comparison to theoretical mass ladders produced by in silico  digestion of a \nFAST A database by a search engine.  \nAn analogy to  the chromatographic separation  and mass spectrometric  characterization  \nprocess is offered  to convey the power of the analytical method  and the complexities associated \nwith reporting the results .   \nSuppose you anticipate  a crowd of more than  100,000 people  at a sporting event , \nand want to characterize that group to profile it relative to other crowds .  To learn how \nmany families are present, which children belong to which parents, how many attendees \nare male or female, how many have red/brown/black/grey/no/other color hair, which \nones are related by marriage, which ones share religious beliefs, as well as  other details \nof their personal lives, it would be helpful to pass them through a turnstile and profile \neach of them individually as they enter the stadium.   \nFor protein digests, t he chromatographic step acts like an imperfect turnstile, \noccasionally  separating peptides as individual s, but more frequently allowing small groups Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n5 \n of 5-50 peptides to enter together.  The tandem mass spectrometer analyzer acts like a \nticket taker and  a discriminating usher, dividing peptides first by size (actually, mass -to-\ncharge or \u2018m/z\u2019 ratio) and then by a host of their secondary characteristics (actually, \u2018MS2 \nspectrum\u2019).  The details that emerge from the MS2 spectrum allow each individual peptide \nto be distinguished and characterized as being related or unrelated to others in the \nmixture.    \nWhy a Common Data Analysis Pipeline?    \nA continuation of this analogy is given in support of a common data analysis pipeline.  \n \nSo how can there be different lists summarizing the characteristics of all of the \nindividuals present in the stadium or proteins in a mixture?  Well, suppose  that the stadium \ndata was  analyzed by crackerjack  polling teams and statisticians  from both The Wall Street \nJournal  and The Washington Post .  The same raw data would be coded and entered  for \nidentical individuals , but two very different profiles of the stadium crowd could  emerge .  \nBoth summaries c ould be valid, and not easily reconciled  by reading  the resulting reports .  \nOne statistical  team  might use home address plus cell phone telephone numbers  plus 2012 \nvoter registration lists to designate  their familial groupings ; the other might use zip code \nplus landline  telephone numbers plus 2010 motor vehicle registration  lists from several \nstates for the same purpose.  The analogous software tools that proteomics specialists \nchoose  have many of the same characteristics that make reconcil iation of a stadium \ncrowd\u2019s characteristics difficult when  different  dated, time -dependent, and incomplete \nreference databases  are used.  Why is this true? Some stadium attendees (babies -toddlers) \nwere born after the databases  were compiled ; some people moved  or married after  the lists Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n6 \n were finalized ; some have changed their phone numbers ; some are visiting from Europe to \nattend a family reunion; others are visiting from Australia  and are unrelated to anyone else \nin the stadium.   Analogous problems arise in every proteomics investigation.  It is \nimpossible  for statistical professional polling teams to accurately align individuals and \nfamily relationships  after the fact, whereas it might  have been obvious to a n attentive  and \nvery inquisitive  usher at the ti me of seating.  Correct assignment of peptides to their parent \nproteins is fraught with all of the problems associated with placement of individuals into \ncorrect family relationships.  While some are unambiguous (distinct peptides that can only \nbelong to a  single protein record , coded by a single gene ), others are shared, common to \nmultiple related proteins  coded by several genes .  The resulting quantitative assessment of \na stadium crowd or a protein list becomes dependent upon the evaluator and the \nevaluat or\u2019s measurement tools.  This becomes even more apparent when time has passed \nand the same evaluators profile another stadium crowd or peptide list , but the databases \nfor their analyses have changed , so that the resulting lists have many non -comparable \nentries.  In contrast, it is certainly possible to c ompar e a stadium crowd at a football \nstadium with an equivalent sized crowd at a baseball stadium many months later if the \nsame evaluators apply the same sets of tools to the crowd characterization .  For this \nreason, the NCI determined that a common data analysis pipeline would be beneficial  for \nreporting  results from multi -institutional cancer tumor proteome studies . \n  Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n7 \n  \nIs Original  Instrument Data Retrievable from the Data Coordinating Center ?   \nData resulting from tandem mass spectrometry analyses is recorded in electronic digital \nfiles and stored in formats that are instrument -specific , unaltered over time, and easily  and \naccurately  replicated .  The  Proteome Characterization Centers (PCCs)  at Vanderbilt University, \nBroad Institute, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  (PNNL) , and Johns Hopkins \nUniversity (JHU)  used Thermo  Fisher mass spectrometers , albeit of  several different models, but \nproducing similarly formatted primary data, denoted as \u2018 Filename.raw\u2019  files.  These \nFilename.raw files were transferred from each participating lab to a central Data Coordinating \nCenter  (see Figure 1).  \nAll Filenames were chosen to follow  a standardized 7 -part naming convention, described in a \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n8 \n document entitled  \u201cCPTAC, TCGA Cancer Proteome Study of Breast Tissue Naming \nConventions \u201d available on the Data Coordinating Center website .  Primary Fi lename .raw files \nare available for public download that preserve the original quality of all the recorded \nexperimental data.   However, to facilitate review of this data for those without access to Thermo  \nFisher proprietary software, the Filename.raw files were converte d to \u2018Filename.mzML\u2019 files.  \nThe Filename.mzML formatted files can be viewed with open source ProteoWizard  software \ntools . Alternatively , the original instrument Filename.raw files can be converted to mz ML or \nother ASCII formats using those same tools, following the installation of MSFileReader  from \nThermo Fisher.  \n  Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n9 \n  \nHow Are Lists of Peptides and Their Intensities Generated at NIST?   \n \nThe processing of  the original  Filename.raw instrument files begins with conversion of the \ndata from  \u2018profile mode\u2019 (point -by-point detail that includes m/z peak shapes, resolution, and \nnoise) to \u2018centroid mode\u2019, simple  peak lists of m/z vs. intensities  (Filename.mgf) . \n  \nThe raw data is preserved in text format profile mode  for isotope analysis and \nquantification software  (Filename.mzXML) .  The file conversion process es use  a NIST \nexpan ded version of the ReAdW   converter software from ISB ReAdw4Mascot2 .  The peak list  \nfile (Filename.mgf)  is annotated to include parameters important to peak area quantificat ion in \niTRAQ experiments  used by Broad, PNNL, and JHU .  The iTRAQ experiment requires each \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n10 \n sample to be reacted with a  chemical label, and as a result, allows 3 patient samples to be  mixed \nand analyzed together with a pooled reference standard  employed for all samples .  The iTRAQ \nexperimental results contain sets of quantitative ratios for each set of 3 patients with respect to \nthe common pooled standard.  The iTRAQ process introduces multiple subtle facto rs into data \nanalysis, and consequently , the Filename.mgf record includes notations for peak purity and \nmissing peaks .  [For a concise description of the iTRAQ quantification method used in these \nanalyses, view this  link.] \nThe next steps are to assign peptide sequences to each MS2 spectrum and perform \nquantitative analyses  (Figure 2) .  There are many software tools for peptide sequence \nassignment, but NCI and NIST  selected MS -GF+ after testing several  alternatives.  MS -GF+ \nrequires a database of protein sequences in a standardized text format (FASTA) in which  each \namino acid  is represented by a single letter code.  The database used  in processing the TCGA \nsamples is the National Center for Biote chnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence \n(RefSeq )  for Homo sapiens (build 37) including  the sequence for  S. scrofa (porcine) trypsin \nadded to each sample .  The RefSeq database is a non -redundant collection of protein sequences  \nfrom archival databases.   A second database compiled from TCGA data for individual patient \ngenes is being evaluated for possible re -analysis with MS -GF+.  NIST developed software for \npeak  profile isotope ana lysis and quantification (ProMS) that uses both the Filename.mzXML \nand Filename.mzid input to produce intermediary  and non -public  working files (Filename. txt). \n  Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n11 \n  \nWhat Types of Analyses Were Performed  on Each Tumor  Type ?  Are They \nDirectly Comparable?  \nTryptically -digested sample s can be divided for the purpose of two different types of \nanalysis \u2013 as peptides, and/or as post -translationally modified peptides.  The PNNL and Broad \ngroups chose to separate and characterize both peptides and post-translationally  phosphorylated \n(addition of a phosphate on serine, threonine or tyrosine hydroxyl groups) peptides as potentially \ncharacteristic of ovarian and breast  tumor biology.  JHU chose to  analyze peptides and  separate \nglycosylated  peptides for ovarian cancer samp les; Vanderbilt did not split the colon cancer \nsamples for post -translational peptide analysis , but added a large sample set of normal colon \ntissues .   \nThe interpretation of mass spectra of phosphorylated peptides requires analysis in addition \nto MS -GF+ in order to assign the likely position(s) of phosphate group attachment, and an \nassessment of the probability of that assignment. The software program PhosphoRS [Taus et al., \nJ Pro teome Res.  2011;10(12):5354 -62] provides that information, and was incorporated into the \npipeline (Figure 2).   \nIn contrast, JHU trapped N-glycosylated peptides onto an ion exchange column, and \nenzymatically cleaved the asparagine -linked peptides prior to elution.  Consequently, the \nresulting de -glycosylated peptides can be sequenced using MS -GF+, with the expectation that \nthe former glycosylated asparagine residues will be identified  as aspartic acid.    \nAlthough the same general technology (liquid chromat ography -tandem mass spectrometry) \nwas used by all of the labs, the results should be expected to differ  because of the above \ndifferences in sample processing .   The iTRAQ -labeled peptides will differ  from  those analyzed Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n12 \n by label -free global analysis . The  iTRAQ/phosphoproteomics will differ from those after  de-\nglycosylation /iTRAQ  analysis.  Each specific analytical method would be expected to reveal \nslightly different characteristics of the tumor samples,  with each one having merit, and all likely \nto yield greater information than any one.  One set of samples was analyzed in part by two \nlaboratories using different techniques.  Both PNNL and JHU analyzed 32 ovarian cancer tumors  \nin common using an iTRAQ/gl obal +phospho method (PNNL) and an iTRAQ global + \ndeglycosylation method (JHU).  \n \nHow Was Quality Control Measured?  Were Standard Reference Materials \nUsed?  \nNIST  perform s quality assessment using parameters derived from each of the output files \nfrom quantitation and isotope analysis [Rudnick  et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 2010;  9(2):225 -41].  \nThe files are reviewed  as complete sets  of runs  so that changes in sample handling, i nstrument \nperformance, chromatography, or computer data handling will be detectable .  Examples of \nmeasured metrics  parameters are shown in Figure s 3 and 4 .   NIST quality control programs \ncalculate and track  more than 40 system characteristics , and four of  those that reflect \nchromatography and mass spectrometry instrument performance are  shown  in Figure 3.  The \nnumber of identified tryptic peptide sequence matches (Figure 4) captures and reflects the \nbottom -line performance consistency for any given laborat ory.   Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n13 \n Figure 3. illustrates the consistency of several different performance metrics for 28 separate \nanalyses collected at one of the Proteome Characterization Centers.  MS1  S/N is the signal -to-\nnoise ratio measured for m/z data after the first stage of orbitrap high -resolution mass analysis; \nMS2 S/N is the same metric after the second stage tandem analysis.  Half -period refers to the \ntime over which the middle 50% of the identified peptides elute, and peak width (fwhm) is a \nmeasure of whether the chromat ographic peaks are changing over time.  Both metrics describe \nchromatographic separation quality and consistency.  \nThe result of NIST QC metric monitoring was an observed consistency within each \nlaboratory  for analyses performed of the TCGA samples .  Becaus e each laboratory conducted \ninternal performance checks, and re-ran samples when  necessary, there were no  failed  patient \nsample runs  found in the data pipeline .  This consistent performance level  was possible because \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n14 \n each participating laboratory  pre-tested their experimental protocol  with system suitability \nstudies  using human -in-mouse xenograft breast cancer tumor reference material (CompRef) \ndistributed to all groups for lab-to-lab and within -laboratory performance check s. The same \nCompRef materials were  run between TCGA samples  for quality control , and the resulting \n\u2018interstitial\u2019 CompRef analyses are available for download on the DCC site .    \n \n \nFigure 4 tracks the number of identified peptides across different experiments from one \nPCC.  Each point is a  mean of the number of peptides ( \u00b1SD)  identified from 24 fractions, as \nillustrated  in the inset graph  for Experiment 5 .  Typically, a lower number of peptides elute in \nthe early and late fractions, and a spread of values is expected  due to biological var iations .  \nMonitoring numbers of peptide sequence matches is a measure of overall PCC  performance .  \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n15 \n How Were Proteins and Genes Assigned?  \nEach peptide sequence in the Filename.psm text report is linked to the list of prot eins that \ncontain that sequence  in the reference database , and as a consequence, an all -inclusive list of all \npossible proteins can be derived from those reports.   However, compiling a n all-inclusive list of \nall possible proteins is not very useful to biologists because it violates the princ iple of parsimony  \n(Occam\u2019s razor) .  Applying this principle, the shortest list of candidate  protein s or genes  that can \nexplain all of the data is more likely to be correct.  Software for performing  parsimonious  protein \nassignments  requires that peptide sequences an d candidate proteins be considered and sorted \ntogether  in order to solve for  the smallest set solution  (Figure 5) .  \nCompounding this task, there are many shared peptides among protein isoforms .  Consequently, \nit is not possible to determine quantitatively how much of each peptide originated from a specific \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n16 \n protein isoform.  Because biologists view proteins as gene products, we elected to bypass the \nprotein isoform conundrum and assign peptides di rectly to a parsimonious set of genes  (Figure \n5), a task performed  at DCC by Dr. Nathan Edwards  using software designed for this purpose .  \nWhile gene assignment  does not eliminate  quantitative  assignment  ambiguity for all cases, \nthe inferred parsimonious set of genes generates a simpler path to the desired output needed by \nbiologists and medi cal professionals, particularly those assessing biological networks and \nsystems.  For biologists interested in biomarker candidates, the only meaningful experimentally  \nmeasured quantitative data resides in the peptide sequence match (Filename.psm) reports.  Any \ninferred summation of quantitative peptide data necessitates compromises . \nWhat Type of Gene Summary Reports are Available?  \nThe gene summaries are experiment specific, so that there are separate sets for PNNL -\novarian, JHU - ovarian, Broad breast, and Va nderbilt colo -rectal cancers.  Each experiment has \ntext summaries, gene-inference ; peptide -gene relationships; gene -inference based quantification \nbased on iTRAQ ratios using m/z117 as a pool reference value; and for label -free (Vanderbilt)  \ngene -inference based spectral count and precursor area quantitation.  \n \nWhy Are Mass Spectral Library Spectra Produced?  \nHow Can They Be Accessed?  \n Mass spectral files accumulated  by the CPTAC project contain >100 million mass \nspectra.  The mass spectrum of each unique peptide sequence exhibits a characteristic \nreproducible pattern of mass/charge vs. intensity, much like an individual\u2019s fingerprint .  \nConsequently, mass spectral libraries of previously characterized components permit very rapid Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n17 \n identification of the  same peptide s when encountered in future studies , a process not unlike \nfinding facts in a library of bound volumes, as illustrated in Figure 7. \n \n \nThe NIST Mass Spectrometry Data Center established repositories  of compound speci fic mass \nspectral data useful for rapid recognition of simple chemical structures like drugs, pesticides, \nsteroids, amino acids, etc., beginning in the 1970s .  These libraries and associated software \nenabling spectral matching have been widely accepted in analytical laboratories worldwide.  \nMore recently,  libraries of tandem mass spectra of peptides recorded using liquid \nchromatographic separ ation, electrospray ionization  using  ion trap -type  instrumentation have \nbeen distributed to the public by NIST after  several steps of curation .  Composite consensus \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n18 \n spectra are derived from comparing many spectra of the same peptide determined at different \nintensi ties, as illustrated in Figure 7.   \n \nCompilations are assembled from spectra acquired using similar mass spectral instrumentation .  \nFor example, the Vanderbilt data yielded a library of > 98 thousand consensus spectra.  These \nwere merged in the latest public release of the NIST Human tandem peptide library that now \ncontain s >340 thousand  consensus  tandem  spectra  recorded using ion trap instrumentation .  Data \nfrom the Broad, JHU, and PNNL studies was collected using a cycloidal ion trap with image \ncurrent detection  (Orbitrap \u2122),  and resulted in a library of  >1 million  consensus  iTRAQ spectra \ndistilled from   > 56 million total collected spectra .   Similarly, s eparat e libraries were compiled \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n19 \n from global and iTRAQ -Phospho Orbitrap \u2122 data sets.   All of these libraries are being distributed \nthrough the NIST public websites or through links accessible on the CPTAC -DCC w ebsite.  \n \nOverview of  Processed Data  \n \nWhat Makes Files from each Institution U nique?  \n The CPTAC studies  of TCGA samples  were planned to utilize state -of-the-art \ninstrumentation i n each institution with the expectation that results are parallel, but not pre cisely \nmirrored.  \n \nTable 1 summarizes some of the key factors that are similar, but differ not only with respect to \ntumor type, but also the sample workup protocol, analytical instrumentation, and  separation.  \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n20 \n How differences in protocols are likely to affect results can be anticipated from general \nunderstanding of the experimental options .  Most importantly, the protocol differences should \nnot alter the underlying biological conclusions reached .  The iTRAQ prot ocol should produce \ntighter quantitative analytical data for comparisons between samples.  Think of competitive track \nracing for an analogy for 4 -plex iTRAQ experiment.  If 4 runners compete in a track race \ntogether and the winner  of the first race compete s with another set of 3 runners,  the result will \nallow precise comparison  of the entire set of seven in the time required to run two races, similar \nto an iTRAQ experiment where 3 samples are mixed with a 4th as a consistent standard.  In \ncontrast, if seve n athletes compete by running individual heats, the seven events will require \nlonger, in analogy to the non -iTRAQ method used by Vanderbilt.   The trade -off is that observers \nof both events view runners either in a group or as individuals.  The iTRAQ exper iment \nsomewhat dilutes the signal for each component, but the non -iTRAQ alternative increase \ncomparative quantitative variability and requires longer instrument time.  Other differences in \nthe protocols (numbers of fractions, type of columns  or fragmentati on) are technical, like \ndifferences in track surface or weather, and not likely to produce substantive differences in data \nsets. \nWhat Makes All Data Sets C omparable?  \n The use of a Common Data Analysis Pipeline results in files that can be directly queried \nand compared with respect to peptides and genes that may be indicative of activated or \nsuppressed pathways in different cancer tumor types.   The parameters listed in Table 2 define   \nsome of the many options that were applied consistently to the processed data sets.  Within \nproteomics, there are many  data analysis software tools, and, in addition to the CDAP, multiple \nanalyses of CPTAC data appear in the scientific literature .  It is likely that summary  data Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n21 \n published by each institution differ s qualitative ly and quantitatively somewhat from that \nprocessed by CDAP  because each lab reports using specifically dated reference databases and \nsoftware tools . \n \nTable 2   \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n22 \n  \nHow and Why Institute Published Data May Differ from CDAP Results  \n First, the bioinformaticians at each Proteome Characterization Center select the search  \nengines, reference databases, and parameters that they believe will produce the most useful and \ncomprehensive data analysis for their output.  While a committee of Proteome Characterization \nCenter members agreed on the publicly accessible and well documented tools and methods for \nthe common pipeline, the same scientists  were free to select software and modify/ extend \ndatabases where they thought there were significant adv antages for processing their own data.   \nFor example, the team at PNNL first \u2018refined\u2019 their mass spectral data, having recognized that \ncertain  instrumental drift could be eliminated while improving the accuracy of m/z assignments.  \nSubsequent peptide searc hing using the same MS -GF+ software enhanced the numbers of \npeptide sequence matches from data relative to CDAP results.  In contrast, the JHU team \nselected  conservative  parameters for processing that yielded slightly fewer peptide sequence \nmatches using t he same MS -GF+ software.  The Broad team prefers a different search engine \n(SpectrumMill, proprietary software  from Agilent ).  Their results substantially agree with those \nfrom the CDAP, but the CDAP\u2019s allowance of semi -tryptic peptides resulted in some pe ptide \nsequence matches that the Broad team prefer s not to include for iTRAQ quantification.  \nVanderbilt\u2019s bioinformatics team elected to use multiple search tools (library search  with \n\u2018Pepitome \u2019 and a  second search engine \u2018MyriMatch \u2019) to improve their abil ity to assign spectra \nrelative to the single MS -GF+ search  used by CDAP .  The multiple search engine and library \nstrategies are well documented to enhance  peptide sequence matching for the  global label -free \nproteomics using Collisional Induced Dissociation  (CID) fragmentation in the LC/MS/MS \nexperiment performed at  Vanderbilt.  Library search strategies are not applicable to   the Higher -Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n23 \n energy C -trap Dissociation  fragmentation ( HCD ) data produced at the other centers, but all of the \nother TCGA data could yield a greater number of  peptide sequence matches with the use of \nadditional search engines that employ strategies orthogonal to that of MS -GF+.   \nTCGA Proteome Data Sets are a Rich Resource for Bioinformatics  Investigations  \nThe composite data sets for e ach TCGA sample experiment are larger and more \ncomprehensive than any previous  proteomic investigations of cancer tumors.  Consequently, they \nare useful for future bioinformatics analyses on many levels. Additional processing is planned \nboth at NIST/DCC an d at each Proteome Characterization Center .  For example, patient -specific \ngenome data will be used to search all data sets for tumor specific peptides.  At the same time, \nemploying second or third search engines may enhance peptide sequence detection.  Th ere are \nlarge numbers of unidentified MS2 spectra from abundant components (30% or more of the total \nacquired spectra) that are consistently observed in samples, and these require invest igation and \ncharacterization.  NIST libraries of frequently encountered, unidentified mass spectra  will aide \nfuture research  by rapidly recognition  of novel components vs. commonly encountered artifacts.  \nAs with any data analysis, the CPTAC data require careful consideration of the \nassumptions and uncertainties inherent within the analysis methods and measurements.  The \nNIST team is responsible for ensuring that biological and clinical conclusions drawn from CDAP \ndata are based on a consistently high level of proteomics data quality.  \n ",

Based on the outcomes from the initial five years of \nresearch funding , an additional  program was launched in August of 2011 entitled  \u201cThe Clinical \nProteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium \u201d, or CPTAC .  CPTAC is a comprehensive and \ncoordinated effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the \napplication of robust,  quantitative, proteomic technologies and workflows.  \nThe participating proteome research groups  in CPTAC  recognized the need for a Common \nData Analysis Pipeline  (CDAP)  in order to remove the multiple sources of variability that would \nresult when trying to compare peptides and proteins inferred by each group  using different \nsoftware .  This overview , for non -proteomic researchers,  explains why and how processing \nchoices produce results that appear to differ both qualitatively and quantitatively.   If you alrea dy \nunderstand the elements of peptide and proteomic analyses using mass spectrometry, you might \nskip this document and proceed to use \u201cA Description of the CPTAC Comm on Data Analysis \nPipeline (CDAP) .\u201d  That document details  stepwise the software programs and output files of the  \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline run at NIST . \nProteomics in a Nutshell  \n{ Note to the reader: If you are completely unfamiliar with proteomics, we suggest reading \n\u201cWhat Is Proteomics \u201d.  There are also numerous reviews which are indexed at PubMed.  \n \nIf you are somewhat familiar with proteomics or are coming at this document from a related \nbackground (e.g., genomics), the following is a brief description and analogy as a refresher. } \n \nTissue samples are digested enzymatically to break large proteins into small segments \n(peptides containing 7 -30 am ino acids) that are amenable to automated analysis and assignment Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n4 \n of their amino acid sequences. The digests contain tens of thousands of peptides .  Each \ntryptically digested tumor sample  mixture is separated  using multiple stages of chromatography \nto allo w more effective mass spectrometric analyses of less complex mixtures.  Typically, a \npatient tumor  sample  digest  was chromatographically separated  into 24 fractions, each of which \nwas analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography  (LC)  coupled to a high -resolution \ntandem mass spectrometer  (MS/MS) .  Once introduced into the mass spectrometer, a small mass \nregion ( containing  1 or a few peptides) is fragmented to produce a sequencing mass ladder where \neach peak in the spectrum ( graph displ aying m/z vs. relative intensity data ) corresponds to a sub -\npeptide, fragmented with missing residues from one end or the other.  It is these mass ladders \nthat are analyzed by comparison to theoretical mass ladders produced by in silico  digestion of a \nFAST A database by a search engine.  \nAn analogy to  the chromatographic separation  and mass spectrometric  characterization  \nprocess is offered  to convey the power of the analytical method  and the complexities associated \nwith reporting the results .   \nSuppose you anticipate  a crowd of more than  100,000 people  at a sporting event , \nand want to characterize that group to profile it relative to other crowds .  To learn how \nmany families are present, which children belong to which parents, how many attendees \nare male or female, how many have red/brown/black/grey/no/other color hair, which \nones are related by marriage, which ones share religious beliefs, as well as  other details \nof their personal lives, it would be helpful to pass them through a turnstile and profile \neach of them individually as they enter the stadium.   \nFor protein digests, t he chromatographic step acts like an imperfect turnstile, \noccasionally  separating peptides as individual s, but more frequently allowing small groups Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n5 \n of 5-50 peptides to enter together.  The tandem mass spectrometer analyzer acts like a \nticket taker and  a discriminating usher, dividing peptides first by size (actually, mass -to-\ncharge or \u2018m/z\u2019 ratio) and then by a host of their secondary characteristics (actually, \u2018MS2 \nspectrum\u2019).  The details that emerge from the MS2 spectrum allow each individual peptide \nto be distinguished and characterized as being related or unrelated to others in the \nmixture.    \nWhy a Common Data Analysis Pipeline?    \nA continuation of this analogy is given in support of a common data analysis pipeline.  \n \nSo how can there be different lists summarizing the characteristics of all of the \nindividuals present in the stadium or proteins in a mixture?  Well, suppose  that the stadium \ndata was  analyzed by crackerjack  polling teams and statisticians  from both The Wall Street \nJournal  and The Washington Post .  The same raw data would be coded and entered  for \nidentical individuals , but two very different profiles of the stadium crowd could  emerge .  \nBoth summaries c ould be valid, and not easily reconciled  by reading  the resulting reports .  \nOne statistical  team  might use home address plus cell phone telephone numbers  plus 2012 \nvoter registration lists to designate  their familial groupings ; the other might use zip code \nplus landline  telephone numbers plus 2010 motor vehicle registration  lists from several \nstates for the same purpose.  The analogous software tools that proteomics specialists \nchoose  have many of the same characteristics that make reconcil iation of a stadium \ncrowd\u2019s characteristics difficult when  different  dated, time -dependent, and incomplete \nreference databases  are used.  Why is this true? Some stadium attendees (babies -toddlers) \nwere born after the databases  were compiled ; some people moved  or married after  the lists Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n6 \n were finalized ; some have changed their phone numbers ; some are visiting from Europe to \nattend a family reunion; others are visiting from Australia  and are unrelated to anyone else \nin the stadium.   Analogous problems arise in every proteomics investigation.  It is \nimpossible  for statistical professional polling teams to accurately align individuals and \nfamily relationships  after the fact, whereas it might  have been obvious to a n attentive  and \nvery inquisitive  usher at the ti me of seating.  Correct assignment of peptides to their parent \nproteins is fraught with all of the problems associated with placement of individuals into \ncorrect family relationships.  While some are unambiguous (distinct peptides that can only \nbelong to a  single protein record , coded by a single gene ), others are shared, common to \nmultiple related proteins  coded by several genes .  The resulting quantitative assessment of \na stadium crowd or a protein list becomes dependent upon the evaluator and the \nevaluat or\u2019s measurement tools.  This becomes even more apparent when time has passed \nand the same evaluators profile another stadium crowd or peptide list , but the databases \nfor their analyses have changed , so that the resulting lists have many non -comparable \nentries.  In contrast, it is certainly possible to c ompar e a stadium crowd at a football \nstadium with an equivalent sized crowd at a baseball stadium many months later if the \nsame evaluators apply the same sets of tools to the crowd characterization .  For this \nreason, the NCI determined that a common data analysis pipeline would be beneficial  for \nreporting  results from multi -institutional cancer tumor proteome studies . \n  Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n7 \n  \nIs Original  Instrument Data Retrievable from the Data Coordinating Center ?   \nData resulting from tandem mass spectrometry analyses is recorded in electronic digital \nfiles and stored in formats that are instrument -specific , unaltered over time, and easily  and \naccurately  replicated .  The  Proteome Characterization Centers (PCCs)  at Vanderbilt University, \nBroad Institute, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  (PNNL) , and Johns Hopkins \nUniversity (JHU)  used Thermo  Fisher mass spectrometers , albeit of  several different models, but \nproducing similarly formatted primary data, denoted as \u2018 Filename.raw\u2019  files.  These \nFilename.raw files were transferred from each participating lab to a central Data Coordinating \nCenter  (see Figure 1).  \nAll Filenames were chosen to follow  a standardized 7 -part naming convention, described in a \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n8 \n document entitled  \u201cCPTAC, TCGA Cancer Proteome Study of Breast Tissue Naming \nConventions \u201d available on the Data Coordinating Center website .  Primary Fi lename .raw files \nare available for public download that preserve the original quality of all the recorded \nexperimental data.   However, to facilitate review of this data for those without access to Thermo  \nFisher proprietary software, the Filename.raw files were converte d to \u2018Filename.mzML\u2019 files.  \nThe Filename.mzML formatted files can be viewed with open source ProteoWizard  software \ntools . Alternatively , the original instrument Filename.raw files can be converted to mz ML or \nother ASCII formats using those same tools, following the installation of MSFileReader  from \nThermo Fisher.  \n  Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n9 \n  \nHow Are Lists of Peptides and Their Intensities Generated at NIST?   \n \nThe processing of  the original  Filename.raw instrument files begins with conversion of the \ndata from  \u2018profile mode\u2019 (point -by-point detail that includes m/z peak shapes, resolution, and \nnoise) to \u2018centroid mode\u2019, simple  peak lists of m/z vs. intensities  (Filename.mgf) . \n  \nThe raw data is preserved in text format profile mode  for isotope analysis and \nquantification software  (Filename.mzXML) .  The file conversion process es use  a NIST \nexpan ded version of the ReAdW   converter software from ISB ReAdw4Mascot2 .  The peak list  \nfile (Filename.mgf)  is annotated to include parameters important to peak area quantificat ion in \niTRAQ experiments  used by Broad, PNNL, and JHU .  The iTRAQ experiment requires each \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n10 \n sample to be reacted with a  chemical label, and as a result, allows 3 patient samples to be  mixed \nand analyzed together with a pooled reference standard  employed for all samples .  The iTRAQ \nexperimental results contain sets of quantitative ratios for each set of 3 patients with respect to \nthe common pooled standard.  The iTRAQ process introduces multiple subtle facto rs into data \nanalysis, and consequently , the Filename.mgf record includes notations for peak purity and \nmissing peaks .  [For a concise description of the iTRAQ quantification method used in these \nanalyses, view this  link.] \nThe next steps are to assign peptide sequences to each MS2 spectrum and perform \nquantitative analyses  (Figure 2) .  There are many software tools for peptide sequence \nassignment, but NCI and NIST  selected MS -GF+ after testing several  alternatives.  MS -GF+ \nrequires a database of protein sequences in a standardized text format (FASTA) in which  each \namino acid  is represented by a single letter code.  The database used  in processing the TCGA \nsamples is the National Center for Biote chnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence \n(RefSeq )  for Homo sapiens (build 37) including  the sequence for  S. scrofa (porcine) trypsin \nadded to each sample .  The RefSeq database is a non -redundant collection of protein sequences  \nfrom archival databases.   A second database compiled from TCGA data for individual patient \ngenes is being evaluated for possible re -analysis with MS -GF+.  NIST developed software for \npeak  profile isotope ana lysis and quantification (ProMS) that uses both the Filename.mzXML \nand Filename.mzid input to produce intermediary  and non -public  working files (Filename. txt). \n  Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n11 \n  \nWhat Types of Analyses Were Performed  on Each Tumor  Type ?  Are They \nDirectly Comparable?  \nTryptically -digested sample s can be divided for the purpose of two different types of \nanalysis \u2013 as peptides, and/or as post -translationally modified peptides.  The PNNL and Broad \ngroups chose to separate and characterize both peptides and post-translationally  phosphorylated \n(addition of a phosphate on serine, threonine or tyrosine hydroxyl groups) peptides as potentially \ncharacteristic of ovarian and breast  tumor biology.  JHU chose to  analyze peptides and  separate \nglycosylated  peptides for ovarian cancer samp les; Vanderbilt did not split the colon cancer \nsamples for post -translational peptide analysis , but added a large sample set of normal colon \ntissues .   \nThe interpretation of mass spectra of phosphorylated peptides requires analysis in addition \nto MS -GF+ in order to assign the likely position(s) of phosphate group attachment, and an \nassessment of the probability of that assignment. The software program PhosphoRS [Taus et al., \nJ Pro teome Res.  2011;10(12):5354 -62] provides that information, and was incorporated into the \npipeline (Figure 2).   \nIn contrast, JHU trapped N-glycosylated peptides onto an ion exchange column, and \nenzymatically cleaved the asparagine -linked peptides prior to elution.  Consequently, the \nresulting de -glycosylated peptides can be sequenced using MS -GF+, with the expectation that \nthe former glycosylated asparagine residues will be identified  as aspartic acid.    \nAlthough the same general technology (liquid chromat ography -tandem mass spectrometry) \nwas used by all of the labs, the results should be expected to differ  because of the above \ndifferences in sample processing .   The iTRAQ -labeled peptides will differ  from  those analyzed Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n12 \n by label -free global analysis . The  iTRAQ/phosphoproteomics will differ from those after  de-\nglycosylation /iTRAQ  analysis.  Each specific analytical method would be expected to reveal \nslightly different characteristics of the tumor samples,  with each one having merit, and all likely \nto yield greater information than any one.  One set of samples was analyzed in part by two \nlaboratories using different techniques.  Both PNNL and JHU analyzed 32 ovarian cancer tumors  \nin common using an iTRAQ/gl obal +phospho method (PNNL) and an iTRAQ global + \ndeglycosylation method (JHU).  \n \nHow Was Quality Control Measured?  Were Standard Reference Materials \nUsed?  \nNIST  perform s quality assessment using parameters derived from each of the output files \nfrom quantitation and isotope analysis [Rudnick  et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 2010;  9(2):225 -41].  \nThe files are reviewed  as complete sets  of runs  so that changes in sample handling, i nstrument \nperformance, chromatography, or computer data handling will be detectable .  Examples of \nmeasured metrics  parameters are shown in Figure s 3 and 4 .   NIST quality control programs \ncalculate and track  more than 40 system characteristics , and four of  those that reflect \nchromatography and mass spectrometry instrument performance are  shown  in Figure 3.  The \nnumber of identified tryptic peptide sequence matches (Figure 4) captures and reflects the \nbottom -line performance consistency for any given laborat ory.   Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n13 \n Figure 3. illustrates the consistency of several different performance metrics for 28 separate \nanalyses collected at one of the Proteome Characterization Centers.  MS1  S/N is the signal -to-\nnoise ratio measured for m/z data after the first stage of orbitrap high -resolution mass analysis; \nMS2 S/N is the same metric after the second stage tandem analysis.  Half -period refers to the \ntime over which the middle 50% of the identified peptides elute, and peak width (fwhm) is a \nmeasure of whether the chromat ographic peaks are changing over time.  Both metrics describe \nchromatographic separation quality and consistency.  \nThe result of NIST QC metric monitoring was an observed consistency within each \nlaboratory  for analyses performed of the TCGA samples .  Becaus e each laboratory conducted \ninternal performance checks, and re-ran samples when  necessary, there were no  failed  patient \nsample runs  found in the data pipeline .  This consistent performance level  was possible because \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n14 \n each participating laboratory  pre-tested their experimental protocol  with system suitability \nstudies  using human -in-mouse xenograft breast cancer tumor reference material (CompRef) \ndistributed to all groups for lab-to-lab and within -laboratory performance check s. The same \nCompRef materials were  run between TCGA samples  for quality control , and the resulting \n\u2018interstitial\u2019 CompRef analyses are available for download on the DCC site .    \n \n \nFigure 4 tracks the number of identified peptides across different experiments from one \nPCC.  Each point is a  mean of the number of peptides ( \u00b1SD)  identified from 24 fractions, as \nillustrated  in the inset graph  for Experiment 5 .  Typically, a lower number of peptides elute in \nthe early and late fractions, and a spread of values is expected  due to biological var iations .  \nMonitoring numbers of peptide sequence matches is a measure of overall PCC  performance .  \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n15 \n How Were Proteins and Genes Assigned?  \nEach peptide sequence in the Filename.psm text report is linked to the list of prot eins that \ncontain that sequence  in the reference database , and as a consequence, an all -inclusive list of all \npossible proteins can be derived from those reports.   However, compiling a n all-inclusive list of \nall possible proteins is not very useful to biologists because it violates the princ iple of parsimony  \n(Occam\u2019s razor) .  Applying this principle, the shortest list of candidate  protein s or genes  that can \nexplain all of the data is more likely to be correct.  Software for performing  parsimonious  protein \nassignments  requires that peptide sequences an d candidate proteins be considered and sorted \ntogether  in order to solve for  the smallest set solution  (Figure 5) .  \nCompounding this task, there are many shared peptides among protein isoforms .  Consequently, \nit is not possible to determine quantitatively how much of each peptide originated from a specific \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n16 \n protein isoform.  Because biologists view proteins as gene products, we elected to bypass the \nprotein isoform conundrum and assign peptides di rectly to a parsimonious set of genes  (Figure \n5), a task performed  at DCC by Dr. Nathan Edwards  using software designed for this purpose .  \nWhile gene assignment  does not eliminate  quantitative  assignment  ambiguity for all cases, \nthe inferred parsimonious set of genes generates a simpler path to the desired output needed by \nbiologists and medi cal professionals, particularly those assessing biological networks and \nsystems.  For biologists interested in biomarker candidates, the only meaningful experimentally  \nmeasured quantitative data resides in the peptide sequence match (Filename.psm) reports.  Any \ninferred summation of quantitative peptide data necessitates compromises . \nWhat Type of Gene Summary Reports are Available?  \nThe gene summaries are experiment specific, so that there are separate sets for PNNL -\novarian, JHU - ovarian, Broad breast, and Va nderbilt colo -rectal cancers.  Each experiment has \ntext summaries, gene-inference ; peptide -gene relationships; gene -inference based quantification \nbased on iTRAQ ratios using m/z117 as a pool reference value; and for label -free (Vanderbilt)  \ngene -inference based spectral count and precursor area quantitation.  \n \nWhy Are Mass Spectral Library Spectra Produced?  \nHow Can They Be Accessed?  \n Mass spectral files accumulated  by the CPTAC project contain >100 million mass \nspectra.  The mass spectrum of each unique peptide sequence exhibits a characteristic \nreproducible pattern of mass/charge vs. intensity, much like an individual\u2019s fingerprint .  \nConsequently, mass spectral libraries of previously characterized components permit very rapid Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n17 \n identification of the  same peptide s when encountered in future studies , a process not unlike \nfinding facts in a library of bound volumes, as illustrated in Figure 7. \n \n \nThe NIST Mass Spectrometry Data Center established repositories  of compound speci fic mass \nspectral data useful for rapid recognition of simple chemical structures like drugs, pesticides, \nsteroids, amino acids, etc., beginning in the 1970s .  These libraries and associated software \nenabling spectral matching have been widely accepted in analytical laboratories worldwide.  \nMore recently,  libraries of tandem mass spectra of peptides recorded using liquid \nchromatographic separ ation, electrospray ionization  using  ion trap -type  instrumentation have \nbeen distributed to the public by NIST after  several steps of curation .  Composite consensus \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n18 \n spectra are derived from comparing many spectra of the same peptide determined at different \nintensi ties, as illustrated in Figure 7.   \n \nCompilations are assembled from spectra acquired using similar mass spectral instrumentation .  \nFor example, the Vanderbilt data yielded a library of > 98 thousand consensus spectra.  These \nwere merged in the latest public release of the NIST Human tandem peptide library that now \ncontain s >340 thousand  consensus  tandem  spectra  recorded using ion trap instrumentation .  Data \nfrom the Broad, JHU, and PNNL studies was collected using a cycloidal ion trap with image \ncurrent detection  (Orbitrap \u2122),  and resulted in a library of  >1 million  consensus  iTRAQ spectra \ndistilled from   > 56 million total collected spectra .   Similarly, s eparat e libraries were compiled \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n19 \n from global and iTRAQ -Phospho Orbitrap \u2122 data sets.   All of these libraries are being distributed \nthrough the NIST public websites or through links accessible on the CPTAC -DCC w ebsite.  \n \nOverview of  Processed Data  \n \nWhat Makes Files from each Institution U nique?  \n The CPTAC studies  of TCGA samples  were planned to utilize state -of-the-art \ninstrumentation i n each institution with the expectation that results are parallel, but not pre cisely \nmirrored.  \n \nTable 1 summarizes some of the key factors that are similar, but differ not only with respect to \ntumor type, but also the sample workup protocol, analytical instrumentation, and  separation.  \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n20 \n How differences in protocols are likely to affect results can be anticipated from general \nunderstanding of the experimental options .  Most importantly, the protocol differences should \nnot alter the underlying biological conclusions reached .  The iTRAQ prot ocol should produce \ntighter quantitative analytical data for comparisons between samples.  Think of competitive track \nracing for an analogy for 4 -plex iTRAQ experiment.  If 4 runners compete in a track race \ntogether and the winner  of the first race compete s with another set of 3 runners,  the result will \nallow precise comparison  of the entire set of seven in the time required to run two races, similar \nto an iTRAQ experiment where 3 samples are mixed with a 4th as a consistent standard.  In \ncontrast, if seve n athletes compete by running individual heats, the seven events will require \nlonger, in analogy to the non -iTRAQ method used by Vanderbilt.   The trade -off is that observers \nof both events view runners either in a group or as individuals.  The iTRAQ exper iment \nsomewhat dilutes the signal for each component, but the non -iTRAQ alternative increase \ncomparative quantitative variability and requires longer instrument time.  Other differences in \nthe protocols (numbers of fractions, type of columns  or fragmentati on) are technical, like \ndifferences in track surface or weather, and not likely to produce substantive differences in data \nsets. \nWhat Makes All Data Sets C omparable?  \n The use of a Common Data Analysis Pipeline results in files that can be directly queried \nand compared with respect to peptides and genes that may be indicative of activated or \nsuppressed pathways in different cancer tumor types.   The parameters listed in Table 2 define   \nsome of the many options that were applied consistently to the processed data sets.  Within \nproteomics, there are many  data analysis software tools, and, in addition to the CDAP, multiple \nanalyses of CPTAC data appear in the scientific literature .  It is likely that summary  data Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n21 \n published by each institution differ s qualitative ly and quantitatively somewhat from that \nprocessed by CDAP  because each lab reports using specifically dated reference databases and \nsoftware tools . \n \nTable 2   \nCommon Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n22 \n  \nHow and Why Institute Published Data May Differ from CDAP Results  \n First, the bioinformaticians at each Proteome Characterization Center select the search  \nengines, reference databases, and parameters that they believe will produce the most useful and \ncomprehensive data analysis for their output.  While a committee of Proteome Characterization \nCenter members agreed on the publicly accessible and well documented tools and methods for \nthe common pipeline, the same scientists  were free to select software and modify/ extend \ndatabases where they thought there were significant adv antages for processing their own data.   \nFor example, the team at PNNL first \u2018refined\u2019 their mass spectral data, having recognized that \ncertain  instrumental drift could be eliminated while improving the accuracy of m/z assignments.  \nSubsequent peptide searc hing using the same MS -GF+ software enhanced the numbers of \npeptide sequence matches from data relative to CDAP results.  In contrast, the JHU team \nselected  conservative  parameters for processing that yielded slightly fewer peptide sequence \nmatches using t he same MS -GF+ software.  The Broad team prefers a different search engine \n(SpectrumMill, proprietary software  from Agilent ).  Their results substantially agree with those \nfrom the CDAP, but the CDAP\u2019s allowance of semi -tryptic peptides resulted in some pe ptide \nsequence matches that the Broad team prefer s not to include for iTRAQ quantification.  \nVanderbilt\u2019s bioinformatics team elected to use multiple search tools (library search  with \n\u2018Pepitome \u2019 and a  second search engine \u2018MyriMatch \u2019) to improve their abil ity to assign spectra \nrelative to the single MS -GF+ search  used by CDAP .  The multiple search engine and library \nstrategies are well documented to enhance  peptide sequence matching for the  global label -free \nproteomics using Collisional Induced Dissociation  (CID) fragmentation in the LC/MS/MS \nexperiment performed at  Vanderbilt.  Library search strategies are not applicable to   the Higher -Common Data Analysis Pipeline Overview  \n23 \n energy C -trap Dissociation  fragmentation ( HCD ) data produced at the other centers, but all of the \nother TCGA data could yield a greater number of  peptide sequence matches with the use of \nadditional search engines that employ strategies orthogonal to that of MS -GF+.   \nTCGA Proteome Data Sets are a Rich Resource for Bioinformatics  Investigations  \nThe composite data sets for e ach TCGA sample experiment are larger and more \ncomprehensive than any previous  proteomic investigations of cancer tumors.  Consequently, they \nare useful for future bioinformatics analyses on many levels. Additional processing is planned \nboth at NIST/DCC an d at each Proteome Characterization Center .  For example, patient -specific \ngenome data will be used to search all data sets for tumor specific peptides.  At the same time, \nemploying second or third search engines may enhance peptide sequence detection.  Th ere are \nlarge numbers of unidentified MS2 spectra from abundant components (30% or more of the total \nacquired spectra) that are consistently observed in samples, and these require invest igation and \ncharacterization.  NIST libraries of frequently encountered, unidentified mass spectra  will aide \nfuture research  by rapidly recognition  of novel components vs. commonly encountered artifacts.  \nAs with any data analysis, the CPTAC data require careful consideration of the \nassumptions and uncertainties inherent within the analysis methods and measurements.  The \nNIST team is responsible for ensuring that biological and clinical conclusions drawn from CDAP \ndata are based on a consistently high level of proteomics data quality.  \n ",
