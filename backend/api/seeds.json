CDS \ncurrently hosts a variety of data types from NCI projects and programs such as the \nHuman Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), Division of Cancer Control and Population \nSciences (D CCPS), and Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI), as well as data from \nindependent research projects.  \nCDS provides data -sharing capabilities for additional studies that fall under the following \ncategories:  \n\u2022 Studies with data that do not match any existing CRDC data commons  \n\u2022 Studies with data that do not fit current data type criteria for any CRDC data \ncommons  \nStudies with data that are on a waiting list to become part of  a CRDC Submission  must \nfollow  the steps  described  in \u201cHow to Submit Data \u201d on page 2.  \nSearching the data housed in CDS is easy to do through the Data page, which has a filter \nfunction to find data by categories.  \nAccess to c ontrolled data requires approval from the NIH Data Access Committee  \nthrough the dbGaP  process . 2 Open -access data is publicly accessible  and does not require any approvals. Being a \ncloud repository, CDS does not facilitate direct downloads of data, owing to high data \ndownload charges. However, programs/initiatives can reach out to the CDS Help Desk  to \nrequest downloads if they are willing to fund download s by users approved to access \ntheir data. Please contact the CDS helpdesk for more  information.  \nAccess to data in CDS for review and/or analysis is through the NCI\u2019s Cloud Resource, \nVelsera Cancer Genomics Cloud  (Velsera /CGC)  (formerly Seven Bridges). See below for a \ndescription of how to select data and import to Velsera /CGC . \nHow to Submit Data  \nThe CDS data s ubmission process ensure s that CDS is the correct  repository to use to  \nshare the data  and metadata collected  and allow basic searches across the data.  The \nprocess enables data release according to open or controlled access requirements.  \n1. Pre-requisites  for data submission:  \na. In the dbGaP registration system , provide the CDS Federal Lead with \ndbGaP Streamlined access to the study . \nb. Select DCF (Data Commons Framework) as the External Database . \nc. Provide dbGaP with the standardized CDS statement for dbGaP release \nnotes .  \nSample statement:  \u201cNote for data in CDS : The data for this study are \navailable via the NCI Cancer Data Service. More information about the NCI \nCDS is available here:  https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/cancer -\ndata -service . The data can be accessed via the Cancer Genomics Cloud \n(https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/datasets/file -repository ).\u201d \nd. Complete the metadata manifest . \ni. Refer  to the CDE Browser  and caDSR  to search for permissible \nvalues (PV)  of metadata elements . \n2. Get started : \na. Complete the CDS New Request Questionnaire . \nb. Contact the CDS Helpdesk email  with questions or comments . \nc. When CDS receives  the completed New Request Questionnaire , they \nschedule  a data intake interview . It takes one week from the time the \nquestionnaire is received to the time the CDS team schedules an hour -long \ninterview . \n3. Discuss the following at the i nitial interview : \na. Questionnaire responses   \nb. Steps taken to de -identify the data  for PHI/PII  \nc. Requirements for d ata storage  and sharing  \nd. CDS Metadata Template  3 e. Review pre -requisites , including  the dbGaP process , if appropriate . \n4. Approval  \na. CDS notif ies the submitter about approval to submit data . This might take \na week if new data types or new requirements are included.  \n5. Submi tter submits  the following : \na. Complete  and Final metadata manifest  \nb. List of Authorized Data Uploaders  (this includes data uploader name/s, \nemail/s ) \n6. Once CDS receives  the Complete and Final metadata manifest, CDS creates Cloud \nBuckets . \na. CDS sends credentials (for uploader , submission POC, PI). This can take up \nto one week . \n7. The s ubmitter upload s data into the CDS  bucket using the provided credentials . \n8. The s ubmitter notifies CDS when submission is complete . \na. CDS locks the bucket , making it read -only . \n9. CDS begins indexing  studies . \n\u2022 This process takes 6 to 8 weeks . \n\u2022 The process includes indexing and authentication and authorization (the \nprocess of data ingestion for release) . \n\u2022 CDS releases the study  data  for secondary sharing on  the CDS page on \nVelsera /CGC (provide link).  \n\u2022 CDS will try to align the release dates with the dbGaP release schedule as \nmuch as possible . \n\u2022 The dbGaP study page provides a link to CDS . Data can be explored on the \nCDS portal and the CDS page on Velsera /CGC . \n10. Access  the controlled access data on Velsera /CGC, from dbGaP . \na. Go to d bGaP and search for the study of interest . \n\u2022 On the dbGaP study page you are redirected to the CDS Data \nCommons page. \n\u2022 Note that t he data is s earchable via  Velsera/CGC  (formerly known \nas SBG-CGC ). \nb. Create an account on Velsera /CGC . \nc. Get approval from dbGaP to access the controlled study . \nd. Access Cancer Data Service (CDS) File Explore . \ne. Copy data into your own space within Velsera and start analysis and \nexploration . \nf. Visit the CDS page on Velsera/ CGC  to see what studies are available and \nfind instructions and guides to use the resources.   4 Explore  Data on the CDS Portal  \nStart on the CDS Portal home page to learn how to navigate the services CDS provides . \nCDS Portal Home Page  \nThe following is the CDS Portal home page.

This is a summary of what is in your submission and includes data such as  \nfilenames, MD5 checksums for the files, and file size. CDS uses the metadata manifest to \nindex the data so it can be made available via NCI Cloud Resources. Once CDS curators \nhave approved the metadata manifest , you will receive credentials to start your data \nsubmission in your bucket on Cloud One. Please note that the indexing process is time -\nconsuming and can take anywhere from six to eight weeks.  \nOnce you are ready to start your submission, CDS curators will send  you instructions on \nhow to upload your data to a cloud S3 bucket. The CDS team  conduct s open office hours \nand can walk you through the technical details to help you get started. Once you are \ndone uploading, reach out to the CDS team  to let us know  and we will lock the bucket \n(you will continue to have read -only access to the bucket).  \nAfter the indexing  is complete, the data will be available through NCI\u2019s Cancer Research \nData Commons (CRDC). NCI requires authentication through  eRA Commons  and dbGaP  \nauthorization to access controlled data.  \nFAQ \nQ: How is the data made available?  \n\u2022 Through NCI Cloud resources: access analysis tools, workflows, and workspaces  \n\u2022 Through NCBI (dbGaP/SRA)  \n\u2022 Both controlled -access and open -access data  \n\u2022 Access is controlled based on dbGaP allow  lists. \n\u2022 General rule: direct data download is not supported . \nQ: What data is eligible for CDS?  11 \u2022 Data from NCI-funded programs, which is being made available for secondary \ndata sharing  \n\u2022 Accepts various data types ( e.g.,  genomic, imaging)  \nQ: How long does the submission process take?  \n\u2022 It can take up to one week  to create a bucket and credentials for a submission . \n\u2022 Indexing: After you send us the metadata manifest and the uploading is \ncomplete , it takes about 6 to 8 weeks to release the data .

CDS \ncurrently hosts a variety of data types from NCI projects and programs such as the \nHuman Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), Division of Cancer Control and Population \nSciences (D CCPS), and Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI), as well as data from \nindependent research projects.  \nCDS provides data -sharing capabilities for additional studies that fall under the following \ncategories:  \n\u2022 Studies with data that do not match any existing CRDC data commons  \n\u2022 Studies with data that do not fit current data type criteria for any CRDC data \ncommons  \nStudies with data that are on a waiting list to become part of  a CRDC Submission  must \nfollow  the steps  described  in \u201cHow to Submit Data \u201d on page 2.  \nSearching the data housed in CDS is easy to do through the Data page, which has a filter \nfunction to find data by categories.  \nAccess to c ontrolled data requires approval from the NIH Data Access Committee  \nthrough the dbGaP  process . 2 Open -access data is publicly accessible  and does not require any approvals. Being a \ncloud repository, CDS does not facilitate direct downloads of data, owing to high data \ndownload charges. However, programs/initiatives can reach out to the CDS Help Desk  to \nrequest downloads if they are willing to fund download s by users approved to access \ntheir data. Please contact the CDS helpdesk for more  information.  \nAccess to data in CDS for review and/or analysis is through the NCI\u2019s Cloud Resource, \nVelsera Cancer Genomics Cloud  (Velsera /CGC)  (formerly Seven Bridges). See below for a \ndescription of how to select data and import to Velsera /CGC . \nHow to Submit Data  \nThe CDS data s ubmission process ensure s that CDS is the correct  repository to use to  \nshare the data  and metadata collected  and allow basic searches across the data.  The \nprocess enables data release according to open or controlled access requirements.  \n1. Pre-requisites  for data submission:  \na. In the dbGaP registration system , provide the CDS Federal Lead with \ndbGaP Streamlined access to the study . \nb. Select DCF (Data Commons Framework) as the External Database . \nc. Provide dbGaP with the standardized CDS statement for dbGaP release \nnotes .  \nSample statement:  \u201cNote for data in CDS : The data for this study are \navailable via the NCI Cancer Data Service. More information about the NCI \nCDS is available here:  https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/cancer -\ndata -service . The data can be accessed via the Cancer Genomics Cloud \n(https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/datasets/file -repository ).\u201d \nd. Complete the metadata manifest . \ni. Refer  to the CDE Browser  and caDSR  to search for permissible \nvalues (PV)  of metadata elements . \n2. Get started : \na. Complete the CDS New Request Questionnaire . \nb. Contact the CDS Helpdesk email  with questions or comments . \nc. When CDS receives  the completed New Request Questionnaire , they \nschedule  a data intake interview . It takes one week from the time the \nquestionnaire is received to the time the CDS team schedules an hour -long \ninterview . \n3. Discuss the following at the i nitial interview : \na. Questionnaire responses   \nb. Steps taken to de -identify the data  for PHI/PII  \nc. Requirements for d ata storage  and sharing  \nd. CDS Metadata Template  3 e. Review pre -requisites , including  the dbGaP process , if appropriate . \n4. Approval  \na. CDS notif ies the submitter about approval to submit data . This might take \na week if new data types or new requirements are included.  \n5. Submi tter submits  the following : \na. Complete  and Final metadata manifest  \nb. List of Authorized Data Uploaders  (this includes data uploader name/s, \nemail/s ) \n6. Once CDS receives  the Complete and Final metadata manifest, CDS creates Cloud \nBuckets . \na. CDS sends credentials (for uploader , submission POC, PI). This can take up \nto one week . \n7. The s ubmitter upload s data into the CDS  bucket using the provided credentials . \n8. The s ubmitter notifies CDS when submission is complete . \na. CDS locks the bucket , making it read -only . \n9. CDS begins indexing  studies . \n\u2022 This process takes 6 to 8 weeks . \n\u2022 The process includes indexing and authentication and authorization (the \nprocess of data ingestion for release) . \n\u2022 CDS releases the study  data  for secondary sharing on  the CDS page on \nVelsera /CGC (provide link).  \n\u2022 CDS will try to align the release dates with the dbGaP release schedule as \nmuch as possible . \n\u2022 The dbGaP study page provides a link to CDS .

GDC functionality. This includes searching for, downloading, and submitting data and metadata. The GDC API uses JSON as its communication format, and standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.\n\nThis guide explains how to construct and execute API requests and interpret API responses.\n\nTools for communicating with the GDC API\n\nMany third-party tools can be used for communicating with the GDC API and for preparing and visualizing API calls.\n\nExamples of tools for communicating with the GDC API:\n\nTool Type Curl Command line tool HTTPie Command line tool Postman REST Client App for Google Chrome and OS X DHC REST Client Google Chrome extension Google Chrome Google Chrome web browser\n\nExamples of tools that can help build GDC API calls:\n\nTool Description JSONLint Validate JSON JSON Formatter Format, validate, and convert JSON to other formats Percent-(URL)-encoding tool Tool for percent-encoding strings\n\nNOTE: When using the command line tool curl be sure to use the bash shell only for compatibility reasons.  All examples using curl are using the bash shell.\n\nThe authentication token should be kept in a secure location, as it allows access to all data accessible by the associated user account.\n\nAPI Endpoints\n\nCommunicating with the GDC API involves making calls to API endpoints. Each GDC API endpoint represents specific API functionality, as summarized in the following table:\n\nEndpoint Type Description status Status Get the API status and version information projects Search & Retrieval Search all data generated by a project cases Search & Retrieval Find all files related to a specific case, or sample donor. files Search & Retrieval Find all files with specific characteristics such as file_name, md5sum, data_format and others. annotations Search & Retrieval Search annotations added to data after curation data Download Used to download GDC data manifest Download Generates manifests for use with GDC Data Transfer Tool slicing BAM Slicing Allows remote slicing of BAM format objects submission Submission Returns the available resources at the top level above programs i.e., registered programs\n\nThe HTTP URL that corresponds to the latest version of a GDC API endpoint is https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/<endpoint>, where <endpoint> is the name of the endpoint.\n\nThe HTTP URL of an endpoint corresponding to a specific major version of the GDC API is https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/<version>/<endpoint>, where <endpoint> is the name of the endpoint and <version> is the GDC API version.\n\nFor example, the address of the latest version of the status endpoint is https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/status, whereas the address of the status endpoint corresponding to version 0 of GDC API is https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/v0/status.\n\nEntity UUIDs\n\nAll objects (entities) in the GDC are assigned a unique identifier in the form of a \u00a0\u00a0version 4 universally unique identifier (UUID). The UUID uniquely identifies the entity in the GDC, and is stored in the entity's id property.\n\nUUIDs are frequently used in GDC API requests and responses to identify specific entities like files, cases, and samples.\n\nSee GDC Data Model for details.\n\nSample Request\n\nThe following is an example of a request to the files endpoint, which retrieves information about a MAF file stored in the GDC.\n\nShell\n\nPython\n\nhttps://api.gdc.cancer.gov/\n\nfiles/cb92f61d-\n\n041c-\n\n4424-a3e9-\n\n891b7545f351?pretty=\n\ntrue\n\nimport requests\n\nimport json\n\nfile_endpt =\n\n'https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/files/'\nfile_uuid =\n\n'cb92f61d-041c-4424-a3e9-891b7545f351'\nresponse = requests.get(file_endpt + file_uuid)\n\n# OUTPUT METHOD 1: Write to a file.\nfile = open(\n\n\"sample_request.json\",\n\n\"w\")\nfile.write(response.text)\nfile.close()\n\n# OUTPUT METHOD 2: View on screen.\nprint(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=\n\n2))\n\nDownload Script\n\nAuthentication\n\nAuthentication is required for downloading controlled-access data, and for all data submission functionality. The GDC API uses tokens for authentication.\n\nUsers can obtain authentication tokens from the \u00a0\u00a0GDC Data Portal and the \u00a0\u00a0GDC Data Submission Portal. See the GDC Data Submission Portal User's Guide for instructions.\n\nUsing Authentication Tokens\n\nAll API requests that require authentication must include a token as an X-Auth-Token custom HTTP header.\n\nIn the following example, an authentication token is saved as an environment variable and passed to curl to download a controlled-access file:\n\nShell\n\nOutput\n\nPython\n\ntoken=$(\n\ncat <gdc-\n\ntoken-text-\n\nfile.txt>)\n\ncurl -O -J -\n\n\"X-Auth-Token: $token\" 'https:\n\n//api.gdc.cancer.gov/data/fd89bfa5-b3a7-4079-bf90-709580c006e5'\n\nTotal    %\n\nReceived %\n\nXferd\n\nAverage\n\nSpeed\n\nTime\n\nTime\n\nTime\n\nCurrent\n\nDload\n\nUpload\n\nTotal\n\nSpent\n\nLeft\n\nSpeed\n100 4161\n\nM  100 4161\n\nM    0     0   281\n\nk      0  4\n\n:12\n\n:45  4\n\n:12\n\n:45\n\n--:--:-- 1894k\n\nimport requests\n\nimport json\n\nimport re\n\n'''\n This script will not work until $TOKEN_FILE_PATH\n is replaced with an actual path.\n'''\n\nwith open(\n\n\"$TOKEN_FILE_PATH\",\n\n\"r\")\n\nas token:\n    token_string = str(token.read().strip())\n\nheaders = {\n\n'X-Auth-Token': token_string\n          }\n\ndata_endpt =\n\n'https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/data/'\ndata_uuid =\n\n'fd89bfa5-b3a7-4079-bf90-709580c006e5'\nheaders = {\n\n'X-Auth-Token': token_string\n          }\nresponse = requests.get(data_endpt + data_uuid, headers=headers)\n\n# The file name can be found in the header within the Content-Disposition key.\nresponse_head_cd = response.headers[\n\n\"Content-Disposition\"]\n\nfile_name = re.findall(\n\n\"filename=(.+)\", response_head_cd)[\n\n0]\n\nwith open(file_name,\n\n\"wb\")\n\nas output_file:\n    output_file.write(response.content)\n\nDownload Python Script\n\nFor more information about authentication tokens, including token expiration and rotation, see Data Security.\n\nNOTE: The authentication token should be kept in a secure location, as it allows access to all data accessible by the associated user account.\n\nNext: Search and Retrieval\n\nSite Home\n                            |\n\nPolicies\n                            |\n\nAccessibility\n                            |\n\nFOIA\n                            |\n\nHHS Vulnerability Disclosure\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n                            |\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n                            |\n\nNational Cancer Institute\n                            |\n\nUSA.gov\n\nNIH...

Overview\nThe GDC API drives the GDC Data and Submission Portals and provides programmatic access to GDC functionality. This\nincludes searching for, downloading, and submitting data and metadata. The GDC API uses JSON as its communication format,\nand standard HTTP methods like GET,PUT,POSTandDELETE.\nThis guide explains how to construct and execute API requests and interpret API responses.\nTools for communicating with the GDC API\nMany third-party tools can be used for communicating with the GDC API and for preparing and visualizing API calls.\nExamples of tools for communicating with the GDC API:\nTool Type\nCurl Command line tool\nHTTPie Command line tool\nPostman REST Client App for Google Chrome and OS X\nDHC REST Client Google Chrome extension\nGoogle Chrome Google Chrome web browser\nExamples of tools that can help build GDC API calls:\nTool Description\nJSONLint Validate JSON\nJSON Formatter Format, validate, and convert JSON to other\nformats\nPercent-(URL)-encoding tool Tool for percent-encoding strings\nNOTE: When using the command line tool curl be sure to use the bash shell only for compatibility reasons. All\nexamples using curl are using the bash shell.\nThe authentication token should be kept in a secure location, as it allows access to all data accessible by the associated user\naccount.\n7API Endpoints\nCommunicating with the GDC API involves making calls to API endpoints. Each GDC API endpoint represents speci\ufb01c API\nfunctionality, as summarized in the following table:\nEndpoint Type Description\nstatus Status Get the API status and version information\nprojects Search & Retrieval Search all data generated by a project\ncases Search & Retrieval Find all \ufb01les related to a speci\ufb01c case, or sample donor.\n\ufb01les Search & Retrieval Find all \ufb01les with speci\ufb01c characteristics such as \ufb01le_name, md5sum, data_format\nand others.\nannotations Search & Retrieval Search annotations added to data after curation\ndata Download Used to download GDC data\nmanifest Download Generates manifests for use with GDC Data Transfer Tool\nslicing BAM Slicing Allows remote slicing of BAM format objects\nsubmission Submission Returns the available resources at the top level above programs i.e., registered\nprograms\nThe HTTP URL that corresponds to the latest version of a GDC API endpoint is https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/<endpoint> ,\nwhere <endpoint> is the name of the endpoint.\nTheHTTPURLofanendpointcorrespondingtoaspeci\ufb01cmajorversionoftheGDCAPIis https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/<version>/<endpoint> ,\nwhere <endpoint> is the name of the endpoint and <version> is the GDC API version.\nFor example, the address of the latest version of the statusendpoint is https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/status , whereas the\naddress of the statusendpoint corresponding to version 0 of GDC API is https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/v0/status .\nEntity UUIDs\nAll objects ( entities) in the GDC are assigned a unique identi\ufb01er in the form of a version 4 universally unique identi\ufb01er (UUID).\nThe UUID uniquely identi\ufb01es the entity in the GDC, and is stored in the entity\u2019s idproperty.\nUUIDs are frequently used in GDC API requests and responses to identify speci\ufb01c entities like \ufb01les, cases, and samples.\nSee GDC Data Model for details.\nSample Request\nThe following is an example of a request to the filesendpoint, which retrieves information about a MAF \ufb01le stored in the GDC.\n1curl https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/files/cb92f61d-041c-4424-a3e9-891b7545f351?pretty=true\n1import requests\n2import json\n3\n4file_endpt = /quotesingle.ts1https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/files/ /quotesingle.ts1\n5file_uuid = /quotesingle.ts1cb92f61d-041c-4424-a3e9-891b7545f351 /quotesingle.ts1\n6response = requests.get(file_endpt + file_uuid)\n7\n8## OUTPUT METHOD 1: Write to a file.\n9file =open (\"sample_request.json\", \"w\")\n10file .write(response.text)\n11file .close()\n12\n13## OUTPUT METHOD 2: View on screen.\n14print (json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))\nDownload Script ## Authentication\n8Authentication is required for downloading controlled-access data, and for all data submission functionality. The GDC API uses\ntokens for authentication.\nUsers can obtain authentication tokens from the GDC Data Portal and the GDC Data Submission Portal. See the GDC Data\nSubmission Portal User\u2019s Guide for instructions.\nUsing Authentication Tokens\nAll API requests that require authentication must include a token as an X-Auth-Token custom HTTP header.\nIn the following example, an authentication token is saved as an environment variable and passed to curlto download a\ncontrolled-access \ufb01le:\n1token=$(cat <gdc-token-text-file.txt>)\n2\n3curl -O -J -H \"X-Auth-Token: $token\"\n/quotesingle.ts1https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/data/fd89bfa5-b3a7-4079-bf90-709580c006e5 /quotesingle.ts1\n1% Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current\n2 Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed\n3100 4161M 100 4161M 0 0 281k 0 4:12:45 4:12:45 --:--:-- 1894k\n1import requests\n2import json\n3import re\n4\n5/quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1\n6This script will not work until $TOKEN_FILE_PATH\n7is replaced with an actual path.\n8/quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1/quotesingle.ts1\n9\n10with open (\"$TOKEN_FILE_PATH\",\"r\") as token:\n11 token_string = str(token.read().strip())\n12\n13headers = {\n14 /quotesingle.ts1X-Auth-Token /quotesingle.ts1: token_string\n15 }\n16\n17data_endpt = /quotesingle.ts1https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/data/ /quotesingle.ts1\n18data_uuid = /quotesingle.ts1fd89bfa5-b3a7-4079-bf90-709580c006e5 /quotesingle.ts1\n19headers = {\n20 /quotesingle.ts1X-Auth-Token /quotesingle.ts1: token_string\n21 }\n22response = requests.get(data_endpt + data_uuid, headers=headers)\n23\n24## The file name can be found in the header within the Content-Disposition key.\n25response_head_cd = response.headers[\"Content-Disposition\"]\n26\n27file_name = re.findall(\"filename=(.+)\", response_head_cd)[0]\n28\n29with open (file_name, \"wb\") as output_file:\n30 output_file.write(response.content)\nDownload Python Script\nFor more information about authentication tokens, including token expiration and rotation, see Data Security.\nNOTE: The authentication token should be kept in a secure location, as it allows access to all data accessible by the\nassociated user account.\n9Chapter 2\nSearch and Retrieval\nSearch and Retrieval\nIntroducing Search and Retrieval Requests\nThe GDC API provides endpoints that search and retrieve information stored in the GDC according to the GDC Data Model.\nThe general format of requests to search & retrieval endpoints is described below.\nNote:Queries described in this section work for datasets that have been released to the GDC Data Portal. Unreleased\ndata that is in the process of being submitted to GDC cannot be queried using these methods. See Submission to\nlearn how to query unreleased data using GraphQL.\nComponents of a Request\nA typical search and retrieval API request speci\ufb01es the following parameters:\n\u2022afilters parameter, that speci\ufb01es the search terms for the query\n\u2022several parameters that specify the API response, such as:\n\u2013format\u2014 speci\ufb01es response format (JSON, TSV, XML)\n\u2013fields\u2014 speci\ufb01es the which data elements should be returned in the response, if available\n\u2013size\u2014 speci\ufb01es the the maximum number of results to include in the response\n\u2013other parameters are described below.\nRequests can be executed using HTTP GET or HTTP POST. GET requests are limited by maximum URL length, so the POST\nmethod is recommended for large queries.\nPOST Example\nThe following is an example of an HTTP POST request to the filesendpoint of the GDC API. It looks for Gene Expression\nQuanti\ufb01cation \ufb01les associated with speci\ufb01c TCGA cases (represented by TCGA barcodes) and retrieves the associated biospecimen\nmetadata in TSV format.\nRequest\n1curl --request POST --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data @Payload\n/quotesingle.ts1https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/files /quotesingle.ts1> response.tsv\nPayload\n1{\n2 \"filters\":{\n3 \"op\":\"and\",\n4 \"content\":[\n5 {\n106 \"op\":\"in\",\n7 \"content\":{\n8 \"field\":\"cases.submitter_id\",\n9 \"value\":[\n10 \"TCGA-CK-4948\",\n11 \"TCGA-D1-A17N\",\n12 \"TCGA-4V-A9QX\",\n13 \"TCGA-4V-A9QM\"\n14 ]\n15 }\n16 },\n17 {\n18 \"op\":\"=\",\n19 \"content\":{\n20 \"field\":\"files.data_type\",\n21 \"value\":\"Gene Expression Quantification\"\n22 }\n23 }\n24 ]\n25 },\n26 \"format\":\"tsv\",\n27 \"fields\":\"file_id,file_name,cases.submitter_id,cases.case_id,data_category,data_type,cases.samples.tumor_descriptor,cases.samples.tissue_type,cases.samples.sample_type,cases.samples.submitter_id,cases.samples.sample_id,analysis.workflow_type,cases.project.project_id,cases.samples.portions.analytes.aliquots.aliquot_id,cases.samples.portions.analytes.aliquots.submitter_id\",\n28 \"size\":\"1000\"\n29}\nEach component of the request is explained below.\nGET Example\nThe above request can be executed as an HTTP GET:\n1https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/files?filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22cases.submitter_id%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22TCGA-CK-4948%22%2C%22TCGA-D1-A17N%22%2C%22TCGA-4V-A9QX%22%2C%22TCGA-4V-A9QM%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%7B%22op%22%3A%22%3D%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22files.data_type%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22Gene%20Expression%20Quantification%22%7D%7D%5D%7D&format=tsv&fields=file_id,file_name,cases.submitter_id,cases.case_id,data_category,data_type,cases.samples.tumor_descriptor,cases.samples.tissue_type,cases.samples.sample_type,cases.samples.submitter_id,cases.samples.sample_id,analysis.workflow_type,cases.project.project_id,cases.samples.portions.analytes.aliquots.aliquot_id,cases.samples.portions.analytes.aliquots.submitter_id&size=1000\nEach component of the request is explained below.\nEndpoints\nThe following search and retrieval endpoints are available in the GDC API:\nEndpoints Description\n\ufb01les Information about \ufb01les stored in the GDC\ncases Information related to cases, or sample donors\nhistory Information related to \ufb01le version history\nprojects Information about projects\nannotations Information about annotations to GDC data\n_mapping Information about elements that can be used to query\nother endpoints\nThe choice of endpoint determines what is listed in the search results. The filesendpoint will generate a list of \ufb01les, whereas\nthecasesendpoint will generate a list of cases.

A \ufb01le may be versioned if a \ufb01le\nis updated by the GDC (e.g. using a new alignment algorithm or \ufb01xing a \ufb01le that contained an error). Version refers to the\ninstance of a particular \ufb01le. Release refers to which data release a \ufb01le was part of.

Q: Is there an association between alterations \nin a particular query gene and age? \nA: We can see that patients with mutations or \namplifications in EGFR tend to be older than \nthose with mutations in IDH1/IDH2 \nLink to this page Now we\u2019re going to go through all the other tabs and \nask some questions about alterations in IDH1 , IDH2  \nand EGFR  in the TCGA Lower-Grade Glioma study. \nNote: Depending on the data available for a \nparticular study, not all of the following tabs will be \npresent (e.g. a study without expression data will not \nhave a Co-expression tab) Cancer Types Summary \nHover over a bar to see \nadditional details. Histogram of the frequency of alterations in \neach gene for each detailed cancer type. \nQ: Are alterations in EGFR more frequent in a \nparticular subtype of glioma? \nA: Yes, astrocytoma appears to have a much \nhigher frequency of EGFR alteration than \noligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma. \nLink to this page Options to \ncustomize \nvisualization Plots for all \nqueried genes \ntogether and \neach individual \ngene are \navailable as \nseparate tabs. \nMutual Exclusivity \nAll pairwise \ncombinations of query \ngenes analyzed for \nmutual exclusivity or \nco-occurrence in the \nqueried samples. On the OncoPrint tab we could \nsee visually that alterations in \nthese three query genes tended to \nbe mutually exclusive. Here we \ncan address that same question \nwith a statistical analysis. \nA positive value here suggests that alterations \nin these genes co-occur in the same samples, \nwhile a negative value suggests that \nalterations in these genes are mutually \nexclusive and occur in different samples. \nlog2(                                               ) odds of alteration in B given alteration in A \nodds of alteration in B given lack of alteration in A \nLink to this page Click on any \ncolumn header to \nsort.

The Furin-like domain \nalso appears to be frequently mutated. Note \nthat these are also statistical hotspots \naccording to the OncoKB & Cancer Hotspots \ntracks and are all located in the extracellular \ndomain according to the Topology tracks. \nLink to this page Mutations \nQ: The mutations in IDH1 appear to be highly recurrent. \nAre these mutations known hotspots? Known oncogenic \ndrivers? Biomarkers for any drugs? \nA: Look at the annotation tracks below the lollipop plot and \nthe Annotation column in the table. Each mutation is \nannotated against 4 different databases with information \nabout recurrence, oncogenicity and drugability. \n     This mutation is in \nMy Cancer Genome .\n        This mutation is annotated in \nCIViC .

Co-Expression \nQ: Several genes on chr7 show high expression correlation with \nEGFR within this cohort (see table on the left). Why might that be? \nA: EGFR is also located on chr7 and is frequently gained in some \nsubtypes of glioma which could explain these correlated increases in \nexpression. This can be further explored in the \u201cCN Segments\u201d tab. \nLink to this page Comparison \nThis tab enables the comparison of all available data types between \nsamples with or without alterations in the query genes. This tab replaces \nand enhances the old \u201cEnrichments\u201d tab. \nThe Comparison tab is the same as the Group Comparison functionality \nthat is accessible from Study View. See the Group Comparison Tutorial  \nfor more details about the functionality of this tab. \nBy default, the \u201cAltered\u201d (one or more \nalterations in one or more query genes) \nand \u201cUnaltered\u201d (no alterations in any \nquery gene) groups are selected. Groups can be toggled on or off by \nclicking on them them. Analyses will \nupdate as the selections change. \nAdditional groups (deselected \nby default) correspond to each \ntrack shown in OncoPrint. \nLink to this page Comparison: Overlap \nThe Overlap subtab shows samples or patients \nthat may overlap among the selected groups. \nSelect one or more regions in the overlap \nplot to create a new group. If you are \nlogged in, this new group can be saved \nto your profile for future use. Saved \ngroups can be found under the \u201cGroups\u201d \nbutton in Study View. \nLink to this page Comparison: Survival \nLink to this page Select among \ndifferent outcome \nmeasures. Options \nhere depend on \ndata availability for \nthe study. The Survival subtab replaces the old \u201cSurvival\u201d \ntab. This subtab will only be visible if outcome data \nis available for the selected study. \nNote: These plots reflect \ndata as provided by the \nstudy. We do not perform \nany additional processing. \nQ: Do patients with alterations in \nIDH1 have different outcomes \ncompared to patients with \nalterations EGFR? \nA: Patients with alterations in IDH1 \nhave significantly better OS than \npatients with alterations in EGFR. Comparison: Clinical \nLink to this page Click on a clinical \nattribute to visualize \nthe data in the plot \non the right. The Clinical subtab compares all available clinical \ndata among the selected groups. Comparison: Molecular Profiles \nLink to this page The molecular profiles \nsubtabs replace the old \n\u201cEnrichments\u201d tab. \nThese analyses ask whether \nGenomic Alterations \n(mutations/copy-number \nalterations) or mRNA \nexpression or protein \nexpression in a particular \ngene is enriched in one of the \nselected groups. These, and \nadditional subtabs like \nMicrobiome Signature, will be \nvisible depending on the data \navailable for each study.

Select sample-level or \npatient-level analysis \nClick on any column \nheader to sort. Hover \nover the column name for \nmore details about how \nvalues are calculated. Hover over a \ndot to see the \ngene name Select which types of \nalterations to include \nin the analysis \nLink to this page Comparison \nQ: Alterations in IDH1, IDH2 \nand EGFR are mutually \nexclusive but some samples \nhave alterations in none of \nthese genes. Do samples \nwithout IDH1, IDH2 or EGFR \nalterations commonly have \ngenomic alterations in one or \nmore other genes? \nA: Alterations in NF1 are \nsignificantly mutually exclusive \nwith alterations in IDH1, IDH2 \nand EGFR (see table). Try \nadding NF1 to the query (check \nthe box next to NF1 and then \nclick \u201cAdd checked genes to \nquery\u201d) and examine the \nOncoPrint and the Mutual \nExclusivity tabs. Notice the distribution of \nsamples with NF1 \nmutations relative to \nsamples with query \ngene alterations. CN Segments \nView copy number for each sample at each query \ngene via the Integrated Genomics Viewer  (IGV). \nClick      for track settings, \nincluding expanding the height \nof each sample (see below) Plots for each gene appear on a separate tab. Toggle track labels, a vertical line \nmarking the center of the viewing screen, \nand a vertical line that moves with your \ncursor. Use          to zoom in or out. \nGene \nstructures Each row is a single sample \nLink to this page \n Click on a read for details CN Segments \nQ: Are amplifications of EGFR focal or \nbroad? \nA: By zooming out, we can see that \nhigh-level amplifications (deeper red) are \nfocal at the EGFR locus, while low-level \ngains (lighter red) are broad. If we continue \nto zoom out, we will see that low-level gains \noften encompass the entire chromosome. \nLink to this page Pathways \nThe Pathways tab replaces the now retired \u201cNetwork\u201d tab.

These samples can be a \nsubset of the data available in an existing study, or result from the combination of \nmultiple existing studies. This cohort of samples can then be queried or explored \njust like a traditional study, and can be returned to at a later date or shared with a \ncollaborator. In this tutorial, we will create a virtual study \ncomprised of a subset of samples from two existing \nTCGA glioma studies. \nWe begin by selecting the studies of interest and \nviewing them in the Study Summary page. Creating a virtual study: Selecting studies \n1. Use the search \nbox to find the \nstudies of interest \n2. Select the studies \nof interest \n3. Click \u201cExplore \nSelected Studies\u201d \nLink to this page Creating a virtual study: Study summary page \nClick on the       to see \nthe list of studies \nThis is the same Study Summary page that you see for a single study, but now \nwith data from 2 studies. \nLink to this page Creating a virtual study: Study summary page \nUse this table to \nselect samples with \nIDH1 mutations \n(Click the check box in the \u201c#\u201d \ncolumn, then \u201cSelect Samples\u201d at \nthe bottom of the table) In this example, we will additionally filter to samples with mutations in IDH1. \nLink to this page We are now ready to create our virtual study. \nWhat you see will differ slightly depending on if you \nare logged in or not. The next two slides show what \nthe virtual study button looks like in each scenario. \nVirtual study button (not logged in) \nEnter a name for your \nvirtual study (optional) \nClick on the link to open \nyour virtual study, or \nclick \u201cCopy\u201d to copy the \nURL to your clipboard.

Virtual study: Study summary page \nWe can now see the study summary page for our newly created virtual study. You \ncan now explore these samples or run a query, just like with a traditional study. \nRemember that while making this study we filtered down to IDH1 mutant samples, but the non-mutant \nsamples were still present. Now, those samples without mutations are completely gone. \nClick on the       to see the \ndescription of this virtual study \nLink to this page Logging in to cBioPortal: \nIf you use a private instance of cBioPortal, you might \nalready go through an authentication process \n(through your university, for example). If so, there is \nnothing else you need to do. \nBut if you don\u2019t normally log in, then let\u2019s go through \nhow this works.

Logging in \nLink to this page \nyour email address \nHere\u2019s the virtual \nstudy I made This is what you see \nwhen you log in Virtual Study Authentication Questions \nIs it necessary to log in to use virtual studies? \nNo. A user that has not logged in can create virtual studies and run queries in \nthose studies (by using the query box on the study summary page). Links to virtual \nstudies are permanent, so you can save the link on your computer and come back \nto it anytime, or share it with others. \nIf I do log in, what additional functionality do I gain? \nIf you log in, you gain the ability to save your virtual study to the list of existing \nstudies on the homepage. This makes a virtual study functionally the same as any \nother study: you can access your virtual studies in the query builder and you can \ncombine an existing virtual study with any other study to create a new virtual \nstudy.

Link to this page Example 3: Run the query \nExample 3: OncoPrint \nLink to this page In general, mutations in these genes are \nmutually exclusive. However, there\u2019s one case \nwith driver mutations in both KRAS and NRAS. \nLet\u2019s look at that patient in greater detail by \nclicking on the patient ID (\u201cTCGA-B5-A0JV\u201d). \nExample 3: Patient View \n3. Could this be related to \ndifferences in clonality? Perhaps the \nPIK3CA mutation is clonal while the \nNRAS & KRAS mutations are in two \ndistinct subclones. If that theory is \ncorrect, we would expect to see \nother mutations with similar variant \nallele frequencies. Indeed,we can \nsee that is true by looking at the \nhistogram of variant allele frequency. 2. Note that all three genes are \ndiploid, so the differences are unlikely \nto arise from copy number alteration. \nLink to this page 1. Look at the Allele Freq column for each mutation. NRAS \nQ61K (19%) and KRAS G12D (21%) have similar variant \nallele frequencies, but PIK3CA E542K is twice as high (38%). Summary of Example 3 : Using Patient View, we \ncan infer the clonality of mutations and understand \nhow two mutations, which are usually mutually \nexclusive, can be present in the same tumor sample. \nIn this case, the KRAS and NRAS mutations appear \nto be present in two distinct subclones of a single \ntumor.

The  Implementation Guidance is intended to help reduce the  \nvar\niability in how network partners populate their  CDM datamarts.  It provides recommendations and preferred approaches when there are multiple interpretations of the CDM specification or if  \nthere is unexpected complexity in a partner\u2019s source data.   The  Implementation Guidance is intended to be a living document, and as such, will be updated more frequently than the CDM  \nspecification  itself .  \nTo accommodate the addition of this material, the CDM page size has been increased from US Letter to US Legal (8.50\u201dx14\u201d).

Introduction  \nWhat is the CDM? \nThe PCORnet Common Data Model (CDM)  \nis a \nspecification that defines a standard organization and representation of data for the  \nPCORnet Distributed Research Network.  \nThe PCORnet CDM is a key component of the PCORnet Distributed Research Network (DRN) infrastructure. PCORnet developed the PCORnet DRN to be a \u201c\u2026functional distributed research \nnetwork that facilitates multi-site patient\u2013centered research across the Clinical Research Networks (CRNs) and other interested contributors. The distributed network will enable the conduct of observational research and clinical trials while allowing each participating organization to maintain physical and operational control over its data.\u201d [Data Standards, Security, and Network Infrastructure Task Force (DSSNI charter), 2014] For more details of CDM development, additional references include: \n\u2022 CDM abstracts presented at scientific conferences: https://github.com/CDMFORUM/CDM -GUIDANCE/wiki/CDM -related -Abstracts \n2.3.  History of  Releases and  Modifications  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 4 of 210 Note on version conventions: Major releases are denoted in  whole number increment s (e.g., v1.0, v2.0, v3.0). Minor releases are denoted with decimal increment s (e.g., v1.1, v1.2) and will be \nused for bug fixes and minor adjustments. Updates to the HARVEST table are typically not listed in the release notes as this metadata table is expected to change to reflect every CDM expansion. \nReference Table: History of Releases \nVersion Date of Release Description of Release \nv1.0 2014-05-30 The DSSNI Task Force thanks the many individuals who provided thoughtful feedback, comments, and suggestions for this first release of the PCORnet \nC\nDM.

Implementation Expectations \nPartners should populate all core CDM tables if data are available in their source system(s). All core CDM tables must be present in an instantiation of the CDM , even if the table is empty. \nThis is important because some components of the querying platform need to locate a given table, even if zero records are pre sent in that table. The fields that are required to be populated for all \nrecords in a given table are listed in the \u201cconstraints\u201d section of each table description.  Any  table and/or field in the CDM may be required for a partner\u2019s participation in a given study or other \nPCORnet activity. In assessing  foundational data quality,  the PCORnet Data Curation query packages may query any CDM table or field ( except for PRIVATE tables) .  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 10 of 210     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n \n   \n  \n  \n    \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                                 \n  3.  Design of the CDM \n3.1.  Special Topics for CDM Modeling \nPrioritization of Analytic Functionality \nPCORnet CDM Guiding Principle  #5 states,  \n\u201cDocumentation will be clear and transparent so that its contents are \nunderstandable to all contributors. The CDM will be intuitive and easy for \nanalysts and investigators to use. Investigators and analysts with prior experience using research data will not need additional skills or \nknowledge to use the CDM.\u201d [emphasis added] \nThis guiding principle is expressed in the CDM design through prioritization of analytic functionality, and a parsimonious approach based upon analytic utility. At times, this results in decisions \nthat are not based in relational database modeling principles such as normalization. The model is designed to facilitate routine and rapid execution of distributed complex analytics. To meet this design requirement, some fields are duplicated across multiple tables to support faster analytic operations for distributed querying. The PCORnet CDM is based on the FDA Mini-Sentinel CDM. This allows PCORnet to more easily leverage the large array of analytic tools and expertise developed for the MSCDM v4.0, including data characterization approaches and the various tools for complex distributed analytics. \nRelational Integrity \nDatabase programmers will notice that fields used as primary/foreign keys, especially PATID and ENCOUNTERID, are specified as text instead of numbers. This approach, informed by prior experience in developing large-scale multi-site distributed networks, makes it easier to implement than requiring new key generation that could impact database management within source systems. \nPlease note that all tables must be present in an instantiation of the CDM, even if data are not populated in every table. \nDate Formatting \nBecause the PCORnet CDM is intended to support multiple Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), date format consistency is an issue, given that most RDBMS\u2019s have platform- specific native date representation.  \nTo address this issue, each RDBMS will  be expected to implement its own native date data type  for dates, which will be supported by the Entity  Framework technology stack1. The CDM  will  \nalways separate date fields and time fields for consistency, and employ  a naming convention of suffix \u201c_DATE\u201d  or \u201c_TIME\u201d.    \nAll times should be recorded within the local time zone. A uniform time stamp or GMT offset is not expected.  \n1  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef.aspx \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 11 of 210         \n     \n \n  \n  \n   \n    \n \n  \n \n    \n     \n \n      \n    \n   \n \n \n  \n      \n \n1.   \n2.     \n3.     \n4.     \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n     A SAS date is different from an RDBMS date. A SAS date is a value that represents the number of days between January 1, 1960 and the specified date. SAS can perform calculations on dates \nranging from A.D. 1582 to A.D. 19,900. Dates before January 1, 1960, are negative numbers; dates after are positive numbers. (Guidance added in v3.1.) \nNumber Formatting \nSAS Number fields have a byte l ength of 8 [SAS Numeric(8)].  This corresponds to an 8- byte floating -point number of approximately 16 significant digits.  When deciding on the precision/scale \nf\nor their RDBMS Number fields, partners should ensure that they do not store numbers in a way that would overflow the SAS numeric data type, which would result in a loss of data when \ngenerating a SAS dataset from the RDBMS.  RDBMS Number can be implemented as any appropriate RDBMS number concept, such as DECIMAL or DOUBLE data types. Although some RDBMS\u2019s have a specific data type called \u201cNUMBER\u201d (such as Postgres), the CDM does not imply that this specific data type should be implemented. \nWhen deciding on the parameters to choose for their RDBMS number fields, network partners should choose a combination that does not result in additional, artificial decimal precision. For \nex\nample: \n\u2022 The value 1. 1 should never  be modified to become 1.10000000 \n\u2022 The integer value of 1 should never be modified to become 1.0 or 1.00000000 \nInstead of specifying a pre cision (total number of digits) and scale (digits to the right of a decimal point) for RDBMS Number data types , the CDM spec has been revised to just read \u201cRDBMS \nNumber.\u201d  Partners should specify the parameters that are most appropriate for their RDBMS that that does not cause a loss of data when generating SAS datasets from the RDBMS or nor result \nin additional, artificial decimal precision. \nMissing or Unknown Data Values \nThe PCORnet CDM will use the HL7 conventions of \u201cNull Flavors\u201d ( https://terminology.hl7.org/1.0.0/CodeSystem-v3-NullFlavor.html http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/v3/NullFlavor /) \na\ns a basis for representing missing or unknown values in all tables except for the LAB_HISTORY table . Specifically, for fields where an enumeration is present (i.e., a categorical set of values), \nwe will populate null values as follows: \nA data field is not present  in the source system. (populate with null) \nA data field for an enumer ation is present in the source system, but the source value is null or blank. (populate with NI=No Information) \nA data field for an enumeration is present in the source system, but the source value explicitly denotes an unknown value . (populate with UN=Unknown) \nA data field for an enumeration is present in the source system, but the source value cannot be mapped to the CDM . (populate with OT=Other) \nThis guidance is only applicable for categorical text fields, not for numbers or dates. \nSource Data Consistency \nThe CDM does not include data consistency rules or edits, such as upper and lower limits of numeric values. The value recorded in the originating source system should be the value populated in  \nt\nhe CDM, even if the value is outside a normally acceptable limit. Inclusion of all originating data, without modification, supports data characterization and better data provenance.  \nDecisions about inclusion (or censoring) of outlier values will be made as part of each analysis or query, allowing for these decisions to be driven by appropriateness for each individual analysis.  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 12 of 210      \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n \n       \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n PCORnet CDM Guiding Principle  #7 states,\n\u201cThe CDM will reflect variables and values found in the local data. If \nsome data are coded in a way that is unique to a site, mapping the data to a \nstandardized format will be necessary. Values in the source data before \nmapping will also be included in the CDM. Derived variables should be \navoided.\u201d [emphasis added] \n\u201cRaw\u201d Fields \nThe data model uses a convention for \u201craw data fields.\u201d These are optional fields for storing the originating source value of a field, prior to mapping into PCORnet CDM value set. It may also be  \nused for source-specific ontologies.  The \u201cRAW\u201d fields are intended to support data provenance and facilitate quality control checking by local implementation, if desired. These fields will have a naming convention of prefix  \u201c\nRAW_\u201d. We will not include these fields in the Entity -Relationship (ER) diagram.  \nThe data model uses  a convention for \u201craw data fields.\u201d In general, these fields are used to store the  originating source value, prior to mapping into PCORnet CDM value set. They  may also be \nus\ned for source- specific ontologies.  For tables that may contain  narrative or textual results (e.g., LAB_RESULT_CM, CONDITION), the \u201cRAW\u201d field can be used to store result values that  \nwould be used in queries  or other analyses.  Partners should not use RAW fields to store internal record IDs.  \nThe \u201cRAW\u201d fields  are inten ded to support data provenance and may be queried by the DRN OC or  others to facilitate quality  assurance activities.  These fields will have  a naming convention of  \np\nrefix \u201cRAW_\u201d.   Partners are encouraged to populate as many RAW fields as possible, but if there are concerns that specific  records or fields may contain PHI, those values should be excluded.  \nHowever,  we discourage the complete exclusion of RAW field values from  the CDM ,  as that will limit  PCORnet\u2019s  ability to assess data quality.    \nCase Sensitivity All RDBMS implementations are case -sensitive. Schema implementations for Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL should be in uppercase (table name, column names, etc.).  Value \ns\net codes should reflect the case formatting in the CDM specification and/or Value Set Reference File.  \nAvoidance of Padding Numbers should not be \u201cpadded\u201d with extra zeroes. Text fields should not be \u201cpadded\u201d with spaces before or after the actual t extual values. \nAdditional Fields PCORnet sites are welcome to include additional fields in their local CDM implementation that will assist with transformation or clarity. \nAs stated in PCORnet CDM Guiding Principle  #8,\n\u201cCRN s may include additional domains and data elements in localized \nversions of the PCORnet CDM.\u201d \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 13 of 210     \n    \n \n \n     \n     \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n    \n      \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n      \n     \n      \n \n \n \n \n    \n   Incomplete Date Guidance \nIn situations where the exact day or month is unknown or not available, it is still necessary to have a valid date for native RDBMS and SAS date data types. In this situation, please use this s\npecific imputation strategy: \n\uf0a7If the day is missing, use the first day of the month to create a valid date value with the existing month and year. \n\uf0a7In the uncommon situation where a month is missing, use January 1 to create a value date value with the existing year. \nThe HARVEST table indicators of DATE_ fields are used to indicate the presence of incomplete dates within the data, and the specific details of imputation would be described in the extract -\ntransform -load ( ETL) Annotated Data Dictionary (ADD). The convention of the RAW_ fields can also be deployed to indicate the presence and original value of incomplete dates, if desired. \nExpanded value sets \nVersion 4.0 of the PCORnet CDM introduced the concept of expanded value sets for fields with dozens or hundreds of allowable options (e.g., LAB_RESULT_CM.RESULT_UNIT, \nP\nRESCRIBING.RX_DOSE_FORM ).  To reduce the size of the CDM specification document, these value sets are provided in a supplementary Value Set Reference File, which is co-located \nwith the CDM specification on the PCORnet web site ( https://pcornet.org/data/). It is expected that these value sets will only be updated as part of a CDM version update, but there may be \nex\ntenuating circumstances where an out -of-sequence update is required. For each value set, we list the raw/expected source value and the corresponding analytics -friendly string to be used when \npopulating the CDM.    \nSupplemental tables Version 4.0 of the PCORnet CDM also formalize d the concept of \u201csupplemental\u201d CDM tables.  These are tables outside of the core CDM that used to support study- specific activities that involve \nt\nhe participation of many network partners.  These table definitions may be managed in separate document(s) outside of the core CDM specification and may be refined out of cycle with the rest \nof the CDM.  Over time, some of these tables may be promoted to the core CDM, at which point they will be governed by the versioning processes of the core.  Network partners are not expected \nto populate these tables unless they are participating in a study that utilizes them. \n3.2.   Development Notes \nPCORnet CDM Guiding Principle  #2 states,  \n\u201cIt is expected that  n ot all  CRNs  will have data needed to populate all  \nparts of the  PCORnet CDM.  It is the responsibility of the  CRN s to \ncommunicate availability of each data  domain and element.\u201d  [emphasis added]  \nThe PCORnet CDM will be implemented in phases. This will allow incorporation of new data domains and fields throughout the life of the project, building based on PCORnet needs, lessons \nlearned from use, and data availability. The assessment of considerations and tradeoffs is an integral part of decision-making based on pragmatism and analytic value. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 14 of 210 Review of \nConsiderations \n& Tradeoffs Resources/expertise \navailable to \nstandardize the data \nAvailability of Data \nElements within a \ngiven domain Time required to \nstandardize the data \nto the CDM Utility & Quality of \nData for PCORnet \nResearch \nBecause the PCORnet DRN has independent objectives and priorities, the PCORnet CDM will not reuse an existing data model, but will develop a stand-alone PCORnet CDM based on existing \ndata models, as appropriate. \nPCORnet CDM Guiding Principle #6 states, \n\u201cOther common data elements and common data model initiatives exist. \nP\nCORnet will draw from the experience of others within and outside of \nPCORI, leveraging existing successful approached and data model \ndefinitions wherever possible.\u201d \nThe model was initia lly informed by results from the PCORnet DSSNI Preliminary Partner Survey (also known as the \u201cTech Survey\u201d) completed in December 2013 and January 2014. \nRecommendations from the PCORnet CDM Working Group have been a basis for strategy and decisions. The PCORnet CDM priority data domains and implementation approach are based on \nPCORI needs, planned future capabilities, and the data sources and expertise of the PCORnet partners. \nAs stated in PCORnet CDM Guiding Principle #4, \n\u201cThe PCORnet CDM will be developed in a modul ar, incremental, and \nextensible fashion. New types of data will be needed, or newly available, \nduring the life of PCORnet. Data domains and data elements will be added, \nrevised, and deprecated throughout an iterative CDM lifecycle.\u201d [emphasis \nadded] \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 15 of 210      \n \n      \n    \n  \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n \n     \n \n     \n \n        \n     \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n  3.3.  Comments on Protected Health Information (PHI) \nThe CDM will contain some of the 18 elements that define PHI under HIPAA, including encounter dates and date of birth. However, these dates will remain under the control of the institutions \nthat already maintain PHI. To maximize analytic flexibility and allow for all types of analyses, complete and exact dates should be included in the CDM. Distributed analytic programs will use the date fields for analysis, but will generate results that contain the minimum necessary information to address the question. The results returned to the requester will typically be aggregated and not include any PHI. Queries that generate results sets with PHI (e.g., a person-level analysis under an IRB, with all necessary data agreements in place) will be clearly flagged as such and will only be distributed with the appropriate approvals clearly documented. As with all distributed queries, sites should review all results before release. \nPCORnet Distributed Research Network Guiding Principle  #2 states,   \n\u201cCRNs will control how their data are used as allowed by internal \ngovernance policies. Data resources developed for PCORnet will stay \nwithin the CRN s and under their control.\u201d [emphasis added] \nThe necessary \u201ccross -walks\u201d between the arbitrary identifiers included in the CDM and their originating data are not specified in the scope of the CDM, but are expected to be maintained by each \ndata partner. \n\uf0a7PATID is a pseudoidentifier with a consistent crosswalk to the true identifier retained by the source site. For analytical data sets requiring patient -level data, only the pseudoidentifier is used to link across \na\nll information belonging to a patient. \n\uf0a7The PATID pseudoidentifier should not be a true identifier. It is not appropriate to use Medical Record Identifiers (MRNs) for this purpose because MRN is a direct patient identifier. \n\uf0a7Locally maintained \u201cmapping tables\u201d are tables necessary to implement so that each data partner has the ability to map arbitr ary identifie rs back to the originating data and patient. \nThese mapping tables are not part of the PCORnet DRN.  Mapping tables for implementation of the CDM should include (but are not limited to):  \n\uf0a7PATID crosswalk \n\uf0a7PROVIDER crosswalk \nPRIVATE tables \nVersion 4.0 of the PCORnet CDM introduced the concept of \u201cPRIVATE\u201d tables , which are intended to provide standardized representations for the commonly-used PHI elements that are \nn\necessary for certain analytic activities  (e.g., patient linkage, geocoding). These tables will not be directly queried by the DRN OC and can remain physically and logically separate from the rest \nof the CDM.  These tables will initially be developed as Supplemental tables through the process described in Section 3.1. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/\t Page 16 of 210 3.4.

Implementation Guidance \nImplementation Guidance is intended to help reduce the variability in how partners populate their CDM datamarts.  It provides recommendations and describes preferred approaches when there \nare mu ltiple interpretations of the CDM specifications or if there is unexpected complexity in a partner\u2019s source data.  The Implementation Guidance is divided into three sections, plus a set of \nreference tables: \n1.\t General guidance : The guidance applies to more than 1 CDM table/domain. These items are included in this section of the CDM Specification. \n2.\t Table-level guidance : The guidance applies to the table/domain in general or applies to more than one field in the table.  Table -level guidance is provided in each table\u2019s description before the table \ns\npecification. \n3.\t Field -level guidance : The guidance applies to implementation decisions that are specific to a given field in a table.  Field -level guidance is provided as an extra column in the CDM table specification. \n4.\t Reference tables: When applicable, reference tables have been created to provide additional guidance to network partners. \nGuidance updated as part of a major CDM revision is highlighted in green .  Guidance updated between major CDM versions is highlight ed in yellow . \nGENERAL Implementation Guidance (spans more than 1 table) \nTopic Guidance \n1 \u2013 Population of RAW fields If a  given record/observation can be directly mapped into the PCORnet CDM, there is no need to populate the RAW values.  RAW  values  \nmay be used when partners need to employ a mapping in order to populate  a given table (e.g., converting local diagnosis codes to ICD-9 or  \nICD-10, mapping internal procedure codes to one  of the specified PCORnet procedure terminologies or converting several doz en race values  \nto the values specified in the PCORnet CDM).  Populating the RAW fields is optional, but if a partner chooses to do so, they  should use the  \nfollowing strategy: \n\u2022  If there is a 1:1  relationship between the source value and the CDM, the RAW value can  be populated on the same record.    \nIn cases where there is a 1:many relationship for multiple records that are part of encounter or have the same timestamp (e.g ., 3 loca l \ndiagnosis codes recorded in the same encounter that map to a single ICD9 code), all of the local values should be concatenated into a single \nRAW observation, with the values separated by  a  pipe delimiter (\u201c|\u201d).  This prevents the creation of  duplicate records in the PCORnet CDM.  \n2 \u2013 Date Obfuscation and/or \nTruncation Do not include shifted or truncated dates within the CDM, with the exception of birth date for patients >89, if required by l ocal regulations.  \nAggregate or de -identified queries that return age for patients >89 will appropriately bucket the results before they are returned. \n3 \u2013 Patients with age > 89 PCORnet queries issued by the DRN OC will bucket all patients age 90+ into one age group to limit the risk of re -identification. Some \npartners \u2019 local regulatory restrictions may require additional protection of date -related data on patients age > 89. For example, some partners \nmight be asked to remove the birth date while others might require that it be shifted to mask the patient\u2019s true date of  birth.  If the birth date \nmust be shifted , these regulatory restrictions would subsequently prevent the same shift from being applied to the rest of the patient\u2019s dat es \nof service, resulting in inconsistencies in the data (see General Guidance #2).  In this case, partners should consider shifting the value in the DEMOGRAPHIC.BIRTH_DATE field for these patients to a dummy date of January 1, 1900.  If this approach is taken, partners should structure their ETL to shift birth dates from patients currently over 89, as well as those that will \u201cage out\u201d and turn 89 before the next \nexpected datamart refresh. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/\t Page 18 of 210     \n  \n  \n     \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n  \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n     \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n  \n    \n GENERAL Implementation Guidance (spans more than 1 table)  \nTopic Guidance \n4 \u2013 Mapping source data to \nstandard terminologies when \nmultiple options exist Some partners with Epic EHRs are able to access diagnoses/problem list entries coded via vocabulary mapping software/middleware (e.g., \nIMO).   Such software/middleware provides mappings to multiple terminologies, so partners have several options from which to choose \nwhen populating their datamart. \nPartners should utilize the vocabulary or terminology that most closely reflects the standard typically used to encode data in that domain at \nthe time the observation was recorded.  For instance, diagnosis codes would use ICD-9 before October 2015, and ICD- 10 afterwards ; \nprocedure co des would be encoded in CPT/HCPCS or in ICD-9 before October 2015 and in CPT/HCPCS or ICD-10 afterwards; p roblem \nlist values would be encoded in SNOMED.  This will allow partners to avoid the potential duplication of records (e.g., if com bining facility \nbilling diagnoses coded in ICD with professional diagnoses coded in SNOMED or mapping the same EHR record to ICD-9 and ICD-10) and more readily allow the application of existing validated algorithms. In these situations, the original codes can be retained  within the RAW \nfields to allow for additional studies that seek to execute exploratory analyses using alternative mappings.  This guidance m ay be revised in \nthe future to incorporate the published findings of subsequent validation studies that compare the downstream analytical results that arise from various mapping strategies.     \n5 \u2013 Approach when there are \nknown errors or missingness in TYPE fields (e.g., PROCEDURES.PX_TYPE, LAB_RESULT_CM.LAB_RES ULT_PX_TYPE, ENCOUNTER.DRG_TYPE, or DIAGNOSIS.DX_TYPE) The PCORnet CDM Guiding Principles ask that data from source systems be populated in the CDM \u201cas is.\u201d However, some fields in t he \nCDM that are used to identify attributes about the data, such as the TYPE fields, are critical to the operation of the PCORne t analytic \nqueries.  If the TYPE field is incorrect, the query will end up using a mismatched code set and return invalid/empty results.  If the errors in the source for the TYPE fields are systemic (e.g., an interface reports all procedure billing codes as I CD-10, when they are really a mix of \nICD-10 and CPT), and the partner is able to isolate and rectify the issue, then the preference is that these data be cleaned befo re populating \nthe CDM.  The same guidance applies if TYPE fields are not populated or are not transmitted from the source system.  The heuristic or algorithm used by the partner should be documented in their ETL ADD.  If there are known systemic issues in other fields or domains, these \ndata should not be cleaned, but partners should make every attempt to resolve or rectify the issue within their source system(s) . Any known \nsystemic issues should also be documented in the ETL ADD. \n6 \u2013 Corrected/updated source \nvalues If a measure/laboratory result has been corrected in the source system, and bot h the original and corrected values are present in the source \nsystem, partners should only include the corrected (e.g., most recent) value in their CDM datamart.  If a measure/laboratory result is \nincluded in their CDM datamart that has later been found to be canceled, partners should remove that value from their CDM datamart in \nsubsequent refreshes. \n7 \u2013  Precision/scale for RDBMS  \nNUMBER fields  This guidance has been deprecated as of  CDM v3.1.  \n8 \u2013 Study -specific datamart \nrestrictions The DRN OC will work w ith networks that operate using a centralized model to ensure that site -specific results are available for all queries \nin the same fashion as distributed data marts. \n9 \u2013  PATIDs  & other  IDs  To the extent possible,  Partners should maintain PATIDs  and all other  ID fields (ENCOUNTERID,  DIAGNOSISID,  PROVIDERID,  etc.)  \nacross refreshes.   In addition, the lengths of these fields should be harmonized across  all tables to facilitate cross-table querying  (see General  \nGuidance #18).  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 19 of 210     \n  \n  \n \n     \n   \n     \n \n \n   \n   \n  \n \n   \n      \n    \n  \n     \n     \n     \n  \n   \n   \n  \n \n      \n \n   GENERAL Implementation Guidance (spans more than 1 table) \nTopic Guidance \n10 \u2013 Units of Measure Starting with PCORnet CDM v4.0, the value set for  the units of measure  fields  (e.g., RESULT_UNIT in LAB_RESULT_CM, OBSGEN  \nand CLINOBS OBSCLIN , and *_STRENGTH_*_ UNIT in PRESCRIBING, DISPENSING and MED_ADMIN) has been expanded to \ninclude values from the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM).  The value set in the Value Set Reference File reflects the list of values \ncurated by LOINC that are most often  used in cl inical reporting ( https://loinc.org/usage/units /).  This list likely includes more values than a \npa\nrtner would have in their source system, but we are providing a more comprehensive list to err on the side of completeness. \nWhen mapping from source data to the UCUM values, partners should choose the code that is the  closest match to their source data.   It is  \ne\nxpected that most units  will have a 1:1 match with the UCUM list, though in some cases, there will be  different spelling variations or  \nrepresentations that need to be harmonized or made singular (e.g., mapping P  ERCENT to %  or liter (s)  to liter ).  For laboratory test results  \nand clinical observations, partners should ensure that there is no discordance between the selected unit of measure and the corresponding test  \ncode (e.g., choosing % as a unit of measure  when the  LOINC code indicates the result is reported as  mg/dL).  \nIt is possible that a partner may have unit values that are not part of the LOINC- curated list.  This is because the universe of UCUM codes is \ne\nssentially unbounded ( http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html#datyp2apdxatblxmp).  We have standardized on the LOINC- curated list to \na\nllow for testing of model conformance.  Units that fall outside of this value set should be mapped to \u201cOT,\u201d with the source value stored in \nthe appropriate RAW field, even if they are technically \u201cvalid\u201d UCUM codes.   \nPlease note that there are s everal instances where  a single unit code maps to multiple entries (e.g., nmol/mg{prot} maps to both \u201cnanomole  \nof\n \u00bd cystine per milligram of protein\u201d and \u201cnanomole per milligram of protein\u201d).  This is a known issue and reflective of how  the curated  \nlist of  codes were created by  LOINC.  The values  were distinct at one point but collapsed due to field length restrictions.  In addition, there  \nare instances where units differ solely by letter  case (e.g., \u201cA\u201d \u2013 ampere, \u201ca\u201d \u2013 year; \u201cMs\u201d \u2013 megasecond, \u201cms\u201d \u2013 millisecond).  As with all \nvaluesets, w e will retain case sensitivity when making comparisons on this field .    \n11 \u2013 Use of \u201cOT\u201d when mapping \nto expanded value sets As partners map their source data to the expanded value sets, the value of \u201cOT\u201d ( Other ) may be used in cases where a source value is \npresent, but does not match any of the responses in the value set .  Additionally, \u201c OT\u201d may be used in those cases when a data partner has not \ncompletely mapped all of their source data to the CDM value set for a given variable (e.g., UNIT, ROUTE, FACILITY_TYPE, etc.).  In this \ncase, partners can include the code from the Value Set Reference File for those entries that have been mapped and \u201cOT\u201d for the remainder \nuntil they have been assigned a code from the value set . Unmapped values should be specified in the corresponding RAW field. \n12 \u2013 Required vs. Optional fields The fields that are required to be populated for all records in a given table are listed in the \u201cconstraints\u201d section of each table \ndescription.  Any  table and/or field in the CDM may be required for a partner\u2019s participation in a given study or other PCORnet activity.  In \nassessing foundational  data quality, the PCORnet Data Curation query packages may query any CDM table or field (Language replicated \nfrom Section 2.5 \u2013 Implementation Expectations). \n13 \u2013 Storing P ROs or other \nobservations with date- type \nresponses When loading PROs with a date -type response, store the character/st ring version of the date in PRO_ RESPONSE_TEXT field, and the SAS \nDate format (Numeric) of the response in PRO_RESPONSE NUM.   Analytically, the PRO_RESPONSE_NUM value will be used in \nqueries.  The same logic applies for observations with date-type responses that might be stored within OBS_CLIN or OBS_GEN. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 20 of 210     \n  \n        \n   \n \n \n      \n    \n  \n \n   \n \n     \n  \n \n      \n  \n  \n \n \n    \n   \n   \n \n \n  GENERAL Implementation Guidance (spans more than 1 table) \nTopic Guidance \n14 \u2013 Future Dates If the source system assigns all unspecified end dates with a far -off future date instead of null (e.g., year 4700) , these values should be set to \nnull when loading the CDM.  Only do this for true \u201cdummy\u201d dates that should truly be blank/null, and only for dates that are systematically \nassigned at the source. \n15 \u2013 Correspondence between \nLOINC classes and CDM tables The LOINC Class Type variable has 4 values (as of May 2018): 1 = Lab Class, 2 = Clinical Class, 3 = Claims Attachment, 4 = Su rvey.  This \ninformation can be found on search.loinc.org or in the LOINC Core files.  In general, observations with a class type of \u201c1\u201d will be stored in \nLAB_RESULT_CM.  Observations with a class type of \u201c2\u201d will be loaded into OBS_CLIN, and observations with a class type of \u201c4\u201d will \ngenerally be stored in PRO_CM, but not definitively . \n16 \u2013 Immunizations Vaccines captured as part o f an immunization workflow should be stored in the IMMUNIZATION table.  If immunizations are present in \nother data streams (e.g., medication administrations, procedures, etc.), however, they should not be removed from those table s. \n17 \u2013 Lab LOINC mappings If partners discover that laboratory results have been assigned an incorrect LOINC code within their source system(s), they s hould make \nevery effort to have it corrected by the personnel who maintain those mappings.  In the meantime, it is acceptable to assign the proper \nLOINC code before loading those results into the CDM.  \n18 \u2013 Harmonized field lengths Fields with undefined lengths that are present in more than one CDM table must have consistent field lengths in all tables.  This constraint \napplies to the following fields: PATID, ENCOUNTERID, PRESCRIBINGID, PROCEDURESID, and all PROVIDERID fields \n(PROVIDERID, MEDADMIN_PROVIDERID, OBSGEN_PROVIDERID, OBSCLIN_PROVIDERID, RX_PROVIDERID, and VX_PROVIDERID).  \n19 \u2013 Undefined field lengths For character fiel ds with undefined field lengths, sites should use the minimum length needed to store the data in order to save storage space \nand reduce query processing time . Field lengths for non- RAW fields  should not exceed 256 characters unless it is absolutely necess ary. \n20 \u2013 Missing time elements For tables with start / stop times (e.g., MED_ADMIN), if there is an incomplete start or stop time within the source system ( e.g., minutes or \nhours are missing), leave the field blank. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 21 of 210     \n   \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n 5.  Table Summaries  (Core Tables)  \nTable Domain Description Table Implementation Guidance \nDEMOGRAPHIC Demographics record the \ndirect attributes of individual \npatients \u2022  The most recently available information should be populated for  BIRTH_DATE, SEX, and other  characteristics. \nIf these attributes have been updated in the patient record, use the most recent value.  \nENROLLMENT Enrollment is a concept that \ndefines a period of time \nduring which a person is expected to have complete data capture. This concept is often insurance-based, but other methods of defining enrollment are possible. \u2022  For partners that do not have insurance-based enrollment information for some of their patients, other  \napproaches can be used to identify periods during w  hich comple te medical capture is expected.  \n\u2022  Members  with medical insurance  coverage, with or without drug c  overage, or should be included.  If a patient  \nhas both medical and drug coverage, create the appropria te enrollment records for each.  \n\u2022  A break in insurance coverage of at least one day  or a change in the chart abstraction flag should  generate a new  \nrecord.  \n\u2022  The ENROLLMENT table provides an important  analytic basis for identifying periods during w  hich medical  \ncare should be observed, for calculating person-time, and for inferring the  meaning of unobserved care (i.e., if  \ncare is not observed, it likely did not happen). The most recently available  information should be populated for  \nBIRTH_DATE, SEX, and other characteristics. If  these attributes have been updated in the patient record, please  \nuse the most recent value.  \nENCOUNTER Encounters are interactions \nbetween patients and providers within the context of healthcare delivery. \u2022  Each ENCOUNTERID will generally reflect a unique combination of PATID, ADMIT_DATE, PROVIDERID and ENC_TYPE. \n \n\u2022  Every diagnosis and procedure recorded during the encounter should have  a separate record in the  DIAGNOSIS  \nor PROCEDURES Tables.   \n\u2022  Multiple visits  to the  same  provider on the same  day may be considered one encounter, especially if defined by  \na reimbursement basis; if so, the ENCOU NTER record should be associated with all diagnoses  and procedures  \nthat were  recorded during those visits.  \n\u2022  Visits to  different  providers for different encounter types on the same day, however, such as a physician \nappointment that leads to a hospitalizatio n, would generally correspond to multiple encounters within the  \nENCOUNTER table.   \n\u2022  Rollback or voided transactions and other  adjustments should be processed before populating this table.  \n\u2022  Although \u201cExpired\u201d is represented in both DISCHARGE_DISPOSITION and D ISCHARGE_STATUS, this  \noverlap represents the reality that both fields are captured in hospital data systems but with variation in how each field is populated. \n \n\u2022  Do not include scheduled encounters.   \n\u2022  Partners should ensure that \u201cadministrative\u201d encounters  (e.g., e-mail, phone, documentation-only), are coded to \nthe appropriate encounter type, which is typically  \u201cOA\u201d  for outpatient visits.  \nDIAGNOSIS Diagnosis codes indicate the \nresults of diagnostic processes \u2022  This table should capture all uniquely recorded diagnoses  for all encounters, with the exception of problem list  \nentries.

Do not omit billing data unless it is \nunavailable from the source system or the partner is certain that the diagnoses loaded from the non- billing \nsystem (e.g., the EHR) represents completely the diagnosis data available from the billing system.  Data from these diffe rent streams have different analytical utility so there is a benefit to including both if available. \n\u2022  Diagnoses are often only related to the treatment of the patient during the specific encounter. Chronic \nc\nonditions that are not be pertinent to the treatment of a specific encounter, for example, would not be expected \nto be present. \n\u2022  If a local vocabulary is used, but cannot  be mapped to a standard vocabulary such as ICD-9- CM, DX_TYPE \ns\nhould be populated as \u201cOther\u201d and the local value stored in DX.  If the local value can be mapped to a standard \nvocabulary, follow the guidance around the population of Raw fields (General Guidance #1). \n\u2022  Partners should continue to populate ADMIT_DATE, even if they are populating DX_DATE.  Analyses may leverage either date, or both.  DX_DATE can be particularly useful for identifying diagnoses or conditions that might have developed over the course of a long inpatient encounter.    \nPROCEDURES Procedure codes indicate the \ndiscreet medical interventions and diagnostic testing, such as surgical procedures and lab orders, delivered within a healthcare context. \u2022  This table should capture all uniquely recorded procedures  for all encounters, including office or  evaluation and \nma\nnagement visits, diagnostic testing, laboratory test orde rs, medication administrations, or other services  \nrendered by a clinician.  \n\u2022  If a patient has multiple procedures ordered during one  encounter, then there would be one record in this table  \nf\nor each procedure.  \n\u2022  ENCOUNTERID should be populated for  DIAGNOSIS and PROCEDURES.

Partners should continue to populate VITAL  with the  \nr\nelevant observations.  Vital measures can also be  stored in OBS_CLIN.  \n\u2022  This table includes measurements recorded in both healthcare and non- healthcare settings.  \n\u2022  The VITAL table contains one record per  result/entry. Multiple measurements may exist in source data (for  \ne\nxample, 3 blood pressure readings on the same day); in this case, each  measurement would be  a  separate  \nrecord.  If multiple vitals are collected at th e same  time (e.g., height, weight and blood pressure  recorded at the  \nstart of an encounter), it is permissible to store these values in a single record.

But if the test is not resulted for  any reason (specimen  \nnot sufficient, patient did not show), then do not include it. \n\u2022  If lab results are stored using local or  custom codes, partners should ensure  that the assigned LOINC  code has  \nb\neen validated by  a subject matter expert or similar p rocess   \n\u2022  If a  LOINC code is available for  a  given result, the  LAB_LOINC field should be populated.  If  a  LOINC code is  \nav\nailable for the order , that value can be used to populate the  LAB_PX field.  Note that one order  can \ncorrespond to many different results.  Each result  should have its own record in the  LAB_RESULT_CM table.  \nIf the same  LOINC code  is used to populate both the order  and the result, partners should ensure that the  \nLAB_LOINC field is populated.    \n\u2022  Inclusion of additional  lab results  - Partner s should include  all  available laboratory results within their  \nL\nAB_RESULT_CM table.  If the result has a  validated  LOINC code, the  LAB_LOINC field should be  \npopulated.  Otherwise, the  LAB_LOINC field should be blank.  The RAW_LAB_NAME  field can be used to \nkeep track of the various  lab results until the appropriate  LOINC  code is assigned.  Lab results beyond the 11 \noriginally included in the PCORnet CDM are being requested in order to establish a denominator of  potentially  \navailable lab results.  Over time,  the number of unmapped results is expected to decrease.  Results for labs  \nperformed as a service  for outside institutions do not need to be included.  Results from external vendors (e.g., \nLabCorp, Quest) should be included when available.  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 25 of 210       \n         \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n Table Domain Description Table Implementation Guidance \n\u2022  Clinical LOINC Co ncepts  \u2013  Only include  Laboratory L  OINC concepts in this table.  Do not include clinical  \nLOINC concepts (e.g., EKG results).  These records may be stored in the OBS_CLIN table.  \n\u2022  Standing orders  - Partners should populate the date fields to the best of their  ability.   For results that are tied to  \ns\ntanding laboratory orders, even if  LAB_ORDER_DATE reflects the date  of the original standing order, \nSPECIMEN_DATE and/or RESULT_DATE would be expected to correspond to the time when the  sample was  \ncollected/resulted.   Analyses will take both dates  into consideration.   \n\u2022  Units of measure \u2013 A  given  LOINC code may have many acceptable units of measure.   If the RESULT_UNIT  \nf\nield is not populated, it may not be possible to use a result analytically.    \n\u2022  Verifying LOINC mappings  \u2013 At most health systems, laboratory results are typically not associated with a  \nL\nOINC code at the time they  are generated but are assigned  a code after the fact.  In order to verify that the \nLOINC code has been  appropriately assign ed, the  PCORnet Coordinating Center will verify that the metadata  \nassociated with the result, such as SPECIMEN_SOURCE and RESULT_UNIT, are valid options.  Partners  \nshould ensure that these fields are populated.  Do not derive these values  based on metadata associated with  \nthe selected LOINC code.  \n\u2022  Titers  \u2013 titer results that  are returned as ratios (e.g., 1:4) should be stored in the RESULT_QUAL field even if  \nthese ratios are not explicitly  enumerated in the QUAL valueset. Beginning in CDMv6.1, data model  \nconformance checks for  RESULT_QUAL will include the enumerated list and text strings of [X]:[Y]. \nCONDITION A condition represents a \npatient\u2019s diagnosed and self-\nreported health conditions and diseases. The patient\u2019s medical history and current \nstate may both be represented. \u2022  This table includes both healthcare and non- healthcare settings.  \n\u2022  Rollback or voided transactions and other  adjustments should be processed (removed) before populating this  \ntable.  \n\u2022  These records should NOT be duplicated in the DIAGNO SIS table .  \nPRO_CM This table is used to store \nresponses to patient- reported \noutcome measures (PROs) , \nsurveys, and  questionnaires.  \nThis table can be used to store item- level responses as well \nas the overall score for each measure. \u2022  This version of the PRO_CM table is not optimized for representational  efficiency.  Certain values will be  \ndupl\nicated across records, and many fields will be  blank for certain records.  Over time, the structure of this  \ntable is expected to evolve as PCORnet better defines the analytical use of  PROs across the network.  Until then, this table has been defined to support the broadest  range of possible use cases at the expense of representational  efficiency.    \n\u2022  The PRO_CM table can be used to store both individual item- level responses, as well as the overall  score for the \nm\neasure/instrument.  Each item response will be stored in an individual record.  Measure/instrument scores can \nbe stored along with the item-level responses that are associated with that  measure (where available).  See the figure below for an example of how to populate this table. \n\u2022  If partners are populating PRO item responses or measure scores and are unsure of the PRO_ITEM_NAME, \nP\nRO_ITEM_LOINC, PRO_MEASURE_NAME and/or PRO_MEASURE_LOINC, they sh ould populate  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 26 of 210       \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n    \n  \n  \n \n \n Table Domain Description Table Implementation Guidance \nPRO_ITEM_FULLNAME and PRO_MEASURE_FULLNAME instead.  These fields can be  considered \nanalogous to RAW fields. \n\u2022  For the PRO_CM fields with variable field lengths, partners should choose an appropriate field length based on \nt\nhe characteristics of the data are loading into the table. As we use these tables analytically as part of PCORnet \nstudies, we will determine whether it is more efficient to define specific field lengths. \n\u2022  If a patient completes a survey, but skips a question, create a record in the PRO_CM table as you would for ot\nher items in the survey (i.e., include the appropriate date/time fields and other relevant metadata).  Then leave \nPRO_RESPONSE_TEXT and PRO_RESPONSE_NUM blank, as these fields are not required.  Do not create empty records if the patient did not actually see the question. \n\u2022  The PRO_CM table can be used to store the results from questionnaires where the provider or caregiver are p\nroviding their interpretation or assessment of the patient\u2019s status.  Despite the name, it is not restricted solely to \npatient -reported outcomes.  The table is designed to represent survey-type responses.  General observations \nabout patients, however, like pain scores recorded in an inpatient or surgical setting, should be stored in the OBS_CLIN tab le.  See General Guidance #15 for additional details or contact the DRN OC with questions.     \n\u2022  In general, patient-reported social determinants of health (e.g., food instability) would be expected to be found in \nt\nhis table.  However, if partners who are pa rticipating in initiatives like the National COVID Cohort \nCollaborative have already loaded those records into OBS_GEN, it is acceptable for them to remain there. \n\u2022  For responses that can be represented as either a number or a text (e.g., a numeric value of  2 corresponds to \n\u201crarely\u201d in a value set), the expectation is to store whatever is recorded in the source system. Both should be \npopulated if present, but partners are not expected to derive the other if not. If values are represented based on a \nsequence number, store the actual value, not the sequence number.  \nPRESCRIBING Provider orders for \nmedication dispensing and/or \nadministration. These orders may take place in any setting, including the inpatient or outpatient basis. \u2022  If a medication cannot be mapped to RxNorm, it should still be present and RAW_RX_MED_NAME should be  \npopul\nated.  \n\u2022  This table can be used to store all medication orders, regardless of encounter type  (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, \nE\nD) and can include orders for medications that are to be dispensed as  well as for those that are to be  \nadministered.  \n\u2022  If including orders derived through natural language processing (NLP), make sure that RX_SOURCE has been popul\nated for all records.  \n\u2022  See Reference Table 4  for the ordering strategy for RxNorm Term  Types.  \n\u2022  Do not populate CDM fields with information derived from the RXCUI (e.g., RX_DOSE_ORDERED, R\nX_DOSE_FORM).  Populate fields only if data are captured in the source system  as a discrete value.  \n\u2022  Populate records  with the RXCUI  as it existed at the time  the order  was entered, even if the RXCUI  is no longer  \na\nctive.  Do not attempt to update inactive RXCUIs with a more recent value.  \n\u2022  Medications with approved formulations should have an RXCUI that can adequately represent  all ingredients  \nwith a single code ( e.g., SBD, SCD, MIN).  For  medication mixtures that lack RXCUIs that can  represent all of  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 27 of 210       \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n Table Domain Description Table Implementation Guidance \nthe component ingredients (e.g., IV mixtures prepared at an inpatient or compounding pharmacy), each \nindividual medication from the order set should be included as a  separate record with a unique PRESCRIBINGID.  If partners wish to preserve the fact that the  records belong to the same order, they do so by  creating and populating a   new  optional ORDERID field.  Medications with a 1:1 correspondence between the  order and RXCUI could have the PRESCRIBINGID stored in the ORDERID.  Orders  with a 1:many RXCUI  relationship would have  different PRESCRIBINGIDs but the same ORDERID.  Future versions of  the CDM  may formalize this guidance. \nPCORNET_TRIAL Patients who are enrolled in \nPCORnet clinical trials and PCORnet studies. \u2022  Partners may use the PCORNET_TRIAL table to maintain mappings between PCORnet CDM PATIDs  and \ne\nxternal trial or study  IDs.  \n\u2022  Partners w ishing to use this table will need to register their TRIALID with the DRN OC.  Please contact the  \nD\nRN OC if  you plan to utilize this table.  \n\u2022  TRIALIDs that start with \u201cPT_\u201d and \u201cPS_\u201d are reserved for PCORnet Trials and PCORnet Studies.   Partners  \ns\nhould refra in  from using TRIALIDs that start with these  characters.  The TRIALID \u201cADPT\u201d is also  reserved.  \n\u2022  One patient participating  in multiple trials or studies will have multiple records  \n\u2022  Each PCORnet trial or study will define its parameters  for study or trial parti cipation, and will provide study-\ns\npecific instructions on how to populate the fields  in this table. \n\u2022  Patients who decline to participate in a trial or study or do not meet eligibility criteria should  not be  included in \nth\nis table  \n\u2022  Patients who enroll in a trial or study but later withdraw  should be included in this table, with a date in the  \nT\nRIAL_WITHDRAW_DATE  field. so that their  withdrawal status and date are  recognized and used to \nappropriately manage reporting of CDM data back t o the coordinating c  enter  \n\u2022  In most cases, trials will be expected to have  a trial database that is separate from the CDM  \n\u2022  Randomization assignment is not included in this table due to the potential for unblinding.  \n\u2022  PATID is not  generally appropriate for use  as  a PARTICIPANTID because it is not disambiguated  across  \nne\ntworks.  \nDEATH Reported mortality \ninformation for patients. \u2022  One patient may potentially have multiple records  in this table because their death may be reported by  different  \ns\nources.  \n\u2022  Deaths  represented in the ENCOUNTER.DISCHARGE_DISPOSITION and  \nE\nNCOUNTER.DISCHARGE_STATUS would generally be expected to be present in this table (see  field- level  \nguidance for DEATH.DEATH_SOURCE). \nDEATH_CAUSE The individual causes \nassociated with a reported \ndeath . \u2022  When legacy data have conflicting reports, please make a local determination as to which to use. There is  \ntypically a 1 -2  year lag in death registry data.  \nMED_ADMIN Records of medications \nadministered to patients by \nhealthcare providers.  These \u2022  If a medication cannot be mapped to RxNorm or NDC, it should still be present and RAW_MEDADMIN_NAME should be populated. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 28 of 210       \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Table Domain Description Table Implementation Guidance \nadministrations may take  \nplace in any setting, including\ninpatient, outpatient or home  \nhealth encounters.  \u2022  Only include  administrations that were  actually delivered to the patient, if that level of specificity is available in  \nt\nhe source system.  \n\u2022  Patient -reported medication administrations are not within the scope of this table. \n\u2022  See Reference Table 4  for the ordering strategy for RxNorm Term Types.    \n\u2022  Do not populate CDM fields with information derived from the RXCUI (e.g., MEDADMIN_DOSE_ADMIN).  P\nopulate fields only if data are captured in the source system as  a discrete value.  \n\u2022  Populate records  with the RXCUI  as it existed at the time the order  was entered, even if the RXCUI  is no longer  \na\nctive.  Do not attempt to update inactive RXCUIs with a more recent value.  \n\u2022  If a medication mixture contains multiple RXCUIs (e.g., inpatient mixture), each individual medication from the  \nor\nder set should be included as an individual record with a unique MEDADMINID.  Each individual medication \nis expected to have a unique dose.  \n\u2022  ENCOUNTERID is expected to be present for records in the MED_ADMIN table.  \n\u2022  For administrations where the amount ordered is listed as a rate (e.g., infusions), if the DOSE/DOSE_UNIT  \nv\nalues are specified as a rate, and those fields are stored discretely in  your  EHR, populate the relevant CDM  \nfields.  Assuming that START_DATE/START_TIME and STOP_DATE/STOP_TIME  are  also populated, it  \nwill be possible  to compute the rate analytically.   Otherwise, leave blank.     \nPROVIDER Data about the providers who \nare involved in the care processes documented in the \nCDM. \u2022  Include one  record per provider.   \n\u2022  When populating provider specialty, if multiple values are  available, use the specialty believed to be primary.  \nOBS_CLIN Standardized qualitative and \nquantitative clinical observations about a patient, including vital signs.  Some observations may also be represented in the VITAL table. \u2022  The OBS_CLIN table is intended to store standardized clinical observations that have been recorded about a  \npa\ntient.   \n\u2022  Examples of the types of  observations that can be  stored in this table include pulmonary function test results  \n(\ne.g., FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC), echocardiogram results  (e.g., left ventricle ejection fraction)  and vital signs  \n(e.g., temperature) .  \n\u2022  Vital signs that can be stored in the VITAL table  may  also be stored in this table (e.g., systolic blood pressure), \nt\nhough VITAL should continue to be populated. The DRNOC maintains a list of  LOINC  codes that  can be used \nto represent these observations.  T he Value Set Appendix contains a list of codes that can be used to map records  \nthat were previously stored in the VITAL table.  For completeness purposes, it contains both preferred and discouraged codes.  Partners should select the  code(s) that best represent the data in their source systems but  \nshould not utilize a code  that encodes more information than is available in their data (e.g., do not use a code  \nthat specifies a method if the method is unknown).  In general, discouraged codes should not be used. \n\u2022  Decisions on what to include in this table and how to prioritize the population of those records are expected to \nbe\n driven primarily by potential funding opportunities.  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 29 of 210       \n\u2022 \t This table provides a  generalized structure  for storing observations and is not optimi zed for analytical efficiency.   \nA\ns elements from this table are used in studies and/or distributed queries, additional representations  of those  \ndata elements (i.e., new table structures) may be required to better support those activities.  \n\u2022\t  If partners are p opulating pain scores (not pain-related PRO surveys) captured in an inpatient or surgical setting, \nt\nhese values would be  expected to be present in this table, not PRO_CM.   \n\u2022 \t If an observation has a value set that includes an option of \u201cnot documented or ass essed\u201d (or similar), these \nva\nlues should be included in the CDM if they are  present in the source system.  Do not derive if  an observation \nis missing.    \n\u2022  If a partner has access to  vital signs that are sourced from a device feed, they  should make an assessm ent about  \nd\nata volume before including these measures, particularly if multiple readings per day are present for a large \npercentage of their population.  Measures should not be averaged or  aggregated.  \n\u2022  For healthcare device data sources:  If multiple readings are available and the volume of data is judged by the \nda\nta partner to be too burdensome for inclusion, using the set of values that were  recorded directly in the  \nmedical record is preferred over any  algorithmic selection process.   \n\u2022  For personal device da ta sources:  If multiple readings are available and the volume of data is judged  by the data \npa\nrtner to be too high for inclusion, the project/study leadership should define a method for selecting individual  \nmeasurements and this logic should be documented in the ETL ADD.  \n\u2022  Observations recorded  together (e.g., diastolic and systolic blood pressure) should have  the same date(s) and time(s).  \n       \n  \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n     \n  \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n    Table Domain Description Table Implementation Guidance \nOBS_GEN Table to store everything else. \u2022\t Partners may use this table to store network -or study -specific data elements. \n\u2022\t Records in this table are not expected to be used in queries distributed by the DRN OC.   \n\u2022\t This table provides a generalized structure for storing observations and is not optimized for analytical efficiency.  \nAs elements from this table are used in studies  and/or distributed queries, additional representations of those \ndata elements (i.e., new table structures) may be required to better support those activities. \nHASH_TOKEN Encrypted hash tokens that \nare used to match patient \nrecords across DataMarts using privacy-preserving record linkage methods. \u2022\t Every patient in the DEMOGRAPHIC table is expected to have one record in the HASH_TOKEN table  for each  \nTOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY.  \n\u2022\t Tokens are generated from personally- identifiable information (PII).  This information can be stored in each \npa\nrtner\u2019s PRIVATE_DEMOGRAPHIC table and PRIVATE_ADDRESS_HISTORY table.  The PII is used as \ninput to the Datavant DeId/tokenization module.  Tokens should not be placed into the CDM until they have \nbeen transformed into Site-PCORnet transit tokens using the Datavant Link/transform-tokens module. \n\u2022\t If PII fields are populated with dummy values by default (e.g., 999-99-9999 for phone number or SSN), these \nva\nlues should be removed before running the Datavant DeID/tokenization module.

P artners can choose to generate tokens for all patients, or \nonl\ny for those patients who were added between refreshes or had updates to their PII. \n\u2022  Select tokens generated using the Datavant DeID/ tokenization module are certified as de -identified data via the \nH\nIPAA Expert Determination method in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR parts 160 and 164). \nAll tokens in the HASH_TOKEN table satisfy this criteria and are controlled via the Datavant DeID PCORnet \nconfiguration settings within the Datavant software. \n\u2022  Additional token strategies are available and can be implemented as needed on a per-study basis based on the s\ntudy- specific data dictionary. \n\u2022  See the Supplemental Guide on Privacy- Preserving Record Linkage for additional implementation details and \ng\nuidance (separate document). \n\u2022  Partners that wish to include tokens encrypted using multiple keys for internal purposes should add a T\nOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY field and store the key name there.  When responding to PCORnet queries/data \ncuration, the table should be filtered to only include tokens used in PCORnet linkages. The name of this key should also be included in the TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY field in HARVEST.  \n\u2022  Partners should include the TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY string that is output from the Datavant Link \ns\noftware.  Please ensure that this table includes tokens encrypted using the PCORnet key (includes \u201cpcornet\u201d or \nsimilar in the output string).

It is designed to store details  related to units of measure and \nnormal ranges  for laboratory  results that do not include such values at the record level.

Table: ENROLLMENT  \nENROLLMENT Domain Description:  \nEnrollment is a concept that defines a period of time  during  \nwh\nich a person is expected to have complete data capture. This \nconcept is often insurance -based, but  other methods of defining  \nenrollment are possible.  \nRelational Integrity: \nThe ENROLLMENT table contains one record per unique combination of PATID, ENR_START_DATE, and ENR_BASIS.  \nPlease note: Each form of coverage (the ENR_BASIS) would have a separate record; for example, if a patient has both medical coverage and drug coverage, these would be 2 separate records, \npot\nentially with different enrollment dates for each record. \nComposite Primary Key: PATID, ENR_START_DATE, ENR_BASIS \nForeign Key: ENROLLMENT.PATID is a foreign key to DEMOGRAPHIC.PATID (many -to-one relationship) \nConstraints: \nPATID + ENR_START_DATE + ENR_BASIS (unique)  PATID  (required, not null)   \nENR_START_DATE (required, not null)  ENR_BASIS (required, not  null)   \nENROLLMENT Table Implementation Guidance \nGuidance \n\u2022  For partners that do not have insurance -based enrollment information for some of their patients, other approaches can be used to identify periods during which comple te medical capture is expected. \n\u2022  Members with medical insurance coverage, with or without drug coverage, or should be included.  If a patient has both medical and drug coverage, create the appropriate enrollment records for each. \n\u2022  A break in insurance coverage of at least one day or a change in the chart abstraction flag should generate a new record. \n\u2022  The ENROLLMENT table provides an important analytic basis for identifying periods during which medical care should be observed, for calculating person-time, and for inferring the meaning of \nunobs\nerved care (i.e., if care is not observed, it likely did not happen). The most recently available information should be populated for BIRTH_DATE, SEX, and other characteristics. If these attribut es \nhave been updated in the patient record, please use the most recent value. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 39 of 210     \n \n  \n   \n \n    \n  \n \n  \n    \n   \n  \n     \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n      \n \n   ENROLLMENT Table Specification \nField Name RDBMS \nData Type SAS Data \nType Predefined Value Sets \nand Descriptive Text for \nCategorical Fields Definition / Comments Data Element \nProvenance Field -Level Implementation \nGuidance \nPATID RDBMS \nText(x) SAS Char(x) .

If partners have access to multiple versions of each diagnosis within a given \nencounter (e.g., admitting, interim, final), the preference is to prioritize final or discharge diagnoses.  A value shoul d be specified in DX_SOURCE to indicate the classification of the diagnosis.   \n\u2022Diagnoses from problem lists will be captured in the CONDITION table. \n\u2022 If a patient has multiple diagnoses associated with one encounter, then there would be one record in this t able for each diagnosis. \n\u2022ENCOUNTERID should be populated for DIAGNOSIS and PROCEDURES. The definitions of the DIAGNOSIS and PROCEDURES tables are depe ndent upon a healthcare context; therefore, the \nencounter basis is necessary and the ENCOUNTERID, PROVIDER ID, ENCOUNTER_TYPE, and ADMIT_DATE from the associated ENCOUNTER record should be included.   While not \ndesirable, a low percentage of orphan records is permissible to accommodate instances in which the associated ENCOUNTER details are missing from the sou rce data. \n\u2022  Data in this table are expected to be from healthcare-mediated processes and reimbursement drivers, including technical/facility billing, professional billing and other data strea ms. Do not omit billing \ndata unless it is unavailable from the source system or the partner is certain that the diagnoses loaded from the non- billing system (e.g., the EHR) represents completely the diagnosis data available \nfrom the billing system. Data from these different streams have different analytical utility so there is a benefit to including both if available. \n\u2022  Diagnoses are often only related to the treatment  of the patient during the specific encounter. Chronic conditions that are not be pertinent to the treatment of a specific encounter, for example, would \nnot be expected to be present. \n\u2022If a local vocabulary is used, but canno t be mapped to a standard vocabulary such as ICD -9-CM, DX_TYPE should be populated as \u201cOther\u201d and the local value stored in DX.  If the local value can be \nmapped to a standard vocabulary, follow the guidance around the population of Raw fields (General Guidance #1). \n\u2022  Partners should continue to populate ADMIT_DATE, even if they are populating DX_DATE.  Analyses may leverage either date, or both.  DX_DATE can be particularly useful for i dentifying \ndiagnoses or conditions that might have developed over the course of a long inpatient encounter.    \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 55 of 210      \n \n   \n \n    \n  \n \n     \n   \n     \n        \n  \n \n     \n \n   \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n  \n  DIAGNOSIS Table Specification \nField Name RDBMS Data \nType SAS Data Type Predefined Value Sets and \nDescriptive Text for Categorical \nFields Definition / Comments Data Element \nProvenance Field -level Implementation \nGuidance \nDIAGNOSISID RDBMS Text(x) SAS Char(x) .

Multiple measurements may exist in source data (for example, 3 blood pressure readings on the same day); in this case, each measurement would \nbe a separ\nate record. If multiple vitals are collected at the same time (e.g., height, weight and blood pressure recorded at the start of an encounter), it is permissible to store these values in a single \nrecord. This table should be populated with all available measures, with the possible exception(s) noted below. \n\u2022  If a partner has access to vital signs that are sourced from a device feed, they should make an assessment about data volume before including these measures, particularly if multiple readings per day are present for a large percentage of their population.  Measures should not be averaged or aggregated. \no For healthcare device data sources: If multiple readings are available and the volume of data is judged by the data partner t o be too bur\n densome for inclusion, using the set of values that were \nrecorded dire ctly in the medical record is preferred over any algorithmic selection process. \n\u2022  For per\nsonal device data sources: If multiple readings are available and the volume of data is judged by the data partner to be too high for inclusion, the project/study leade rship should define a method \nfor selecting individual measurements. in the ETL ADD . \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 69 of 210     \n \n \n \n    \n \n    \n  \n \n      \n   \n     \n     \n \n      \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     Figure 1.

If the result suggests that the test was run (e.g., result is \"borderlin e\" or \"inconclusive\") include it. But if the test is not resulted for \nany reason (specimen not sufficient, patient did not show), t hen do not include it. \n\u2022If lab results are stored using local or custom codes, partners should ensure that the assigned LOINC code has been validated by a subject matter expert or similar process \n\u2022  If a LOINC code is available for a given result, the LAB_LOINC field should be populated.  If a LOINC code is available for t he o rder, that value can be used to populate the LAB_PX field.  Note \nthat one order can correspond to many different results.  Each result should have its own record in the LAB_RESULT_CM table.  If the same LOINC code is used to populate both the order and the \nresult, partners should ensure that the LAB_LOINC field is populated.  \n\u2022  Inclusion of additional lab results -Partners should include all available laboratory results within their LAB_RESULT_CM table.  If the result has a validated LOINC code, the LAB_LOINC field \nshoul\nd be populated.  Otherwise, the LAB_LOINC field should be blank.  The RAW_LAB_NAME field can be used to keep track of the various lab results until the appropriate LOINC code is \nassigned. Lab results beyond the 11 originally included in the PCORnet CDM are being requested in order to establish a denominator of potentially available lab results.  Over time, the numb er of \nunmapped results is expected to decrease.   Results for labs performed as a service for outside institutions do not need to be included.  Results from external vendors (e.g., LabCorp, Quest) should be \nincluded when available. \n\u2022  Clinical LOINC Concepts \u2013 Only include Laboratory LOINC concepts in this table.  Do not include clinical LOINC concepts (e.g., EKG results).  These records may be stored in the OBS_CLIN \ntab\nle. \n\u2022  Standing orders - Partners should populate the date fields to the best of their ability.  For results that are tied to standing laboratory orders, even if LAB_ORDER_DATE reflects the date of the \nori\nginal standing order, SPECIMEN_DATE and/or RESULT_DATE would be expected to correspond to the time when the sample was collected/resulted.  Analys es will take both dates into \nconsideration.  \n\u2022  Units of measure \u2013 A given LOINC code may have many acceptable units of measure.  If the RESULT_UNIT field is not populated, it may not be possi ble to use a result analytically. \n\u2022  Verifying LOINC mappings \u2013 At most health systems, laboratory results are typically not associated with a LOINC code at the time they are generated but are assigned a code after the fact. In order \nto v\nerify that the LOINC code has been appropriately assigned, the PCORnet Coordinat ing Center will verify that the metadata associated with the result, such as SPECIMEN_SOURCE and \nRESULT_UNIT, are valid options.  Partners should ensure that these fields are populated.  Do not derive these values based on metadata associated with the selected LOINC code. \n\u2022 Titers \u2013 titer results that are returned as ratios (e.g., 1:4) should be stored in the RESULT_QUAL field even if these ratios are not explicitly enumerated in the QUAL valueset. Beginning in CDM v6.1, \ndat\na model conformance checks for RESUL T_QUAL will include the enumerated list and text strings of [X]:[Y] as acceptable values.  \nLAB_RESULT_CM Table Specification \nField Name RDBMS Data Type SAS Data Type Predefined Value Sets and \nDescriptive Text for Categorical \nFields Definition / Comments Data Element \nProvenance Field -level Implementation \nGuidance \nLAB_RESULT_CM_ID RDBMS Text(x) SAS Char(x) .

Table: PRO_CM \nPRO_CM Domain Description:   \nThis ta\nble is used to store responses to patient-reported outcome \nmeasures (PROs ), surveys, and questionnaires.  This table can be \nused to store item -level responses as well as the overall score for \neach measure. \n(Domain description updated in v4.0) \nRelational Integrity: \nThe PRO_ CM table contains one record per PRO_CM_ID. \nPrimary Key: PRO_CM_ID \nForeign Keys: PRO_CM.PATID is a foreign key to DEMOGRAPHIC.PATID (many -to-one relationship)\n \nPRO_CM.ENCOUNTERID is a  f\n oreign key to ENCOUNTER.ENCOUNTERID (zero /many -to-one relationship)\n  \n Co\nnstraints :\n  \nPRO_CM_ID (unique; required, not null)\n PATID  (\nrequired, not null)  \n \nPRO_DATE (required, not null)\n \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 98 of 210      \n \n         \n      \n     \n      \n        \n     \n   \n      \n \n         \n       \n     \n      \n   \n       \n  \n           \n        \n PRO_CM Table Implementation Guidance \nGuidance \n\u2022 This version of the PRO_CM table is not optimized for representational efficiency.  Certain values will be duplicated across records, and ma ny fields will be blank for certain records.  Over time, the \nstructure of this table is expected to evolve as PCORnet better defines the analytical use of PROs across the network.  Until then, this table has been defined to support the broadest range of possible \nuse cases at the expense of representational efficiency. \n\u2022  The PRO_CM table can be used to store both individual item- level responses, as well as the overall score for the measure/instrument.  Each item response will be stored in an individual record .  \nMeas\nure/instrument scores can be stored along with the item -level responses that are associated with that measure (where available).  See the figure below for an example of how to populate th is table. \n\u2022 If partners are populating PRO item responses or measure scores and are unsure of the PRO_ITEM_NAME, PRO_ITEM_LOINC, PRO_MEASURE_NAME and/or PRO_MEASURE_LOINC, they \ns\nhould populate PRO_ITEM_FULLNAME and PRO_MEASURE_FULLNAME instead. These fields can be considered analogous to RAW fields. \n\u2022 For the PRO_CM fields with variable field lengths, p artners should choose an appropriate field length based on the characteristics of the data are loading into the table. As we use these tables \nan\nalytically as part of PCORnet studies, we will determine whether it is more efficient to define specific field l engths. \n\u2022 If a patient completes a survey, but skips a question, create a record in the PRO_CM table as you would for other items in th e survey (i.e., include the appropriate date/time fields and other relevant \nm\netadata). Then leave PRO_RESPONSE_TEXT and PR O_RESPONSE_NUM blank, as these fields are not required.  Do not create empty records if the patient did not actually see the question. \n\u2022  The PRO_CM table can be used to store the results from questionnaires where the provider or caregiver are providing their interpretation or assessment of the patient\u2019s status.  Despite the name, it is \nn\not restricted solely to patient- reported outcomes. The table is designed to represent survey -type responses. General observations about patients, however, like pain scores r ecorded in an inpatient or \nsurgical setting, should be stored in the OBS_CLIN table.  See General Guidance #15 for additional details or contact the DRN OC with questions.    \n\u2022 In general, patient-reported social determinants of health (e.g., food instability) would be expected to be found in this table.  However, if partners who are participating in initiatives like the National \nC\nOVID Cohort Collaborative have already loaded those records into OBS_GEN, it is acceptable for them to remain there. \n\u2022  For responses that can be represented as either a number or a text (e.g., a numeric value of 2 corresponds to \u201crarely\u201d in a v alue set), the expectation is to store whatever is recorded in the source system. \nBoth should be populated if present, but partners are not expected to derive the other if not.  If values are represented based on a sequence number, store the actual value, not the sequence number. \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 99 of 210 Note: Not all fields are shown \nNote: Scores not correctly calculated \nPRO_CM_ID PATIO ENCOUNTERID PRO_TYPE ,PRO_ITEM_NAME PRO_ITEM _ \nLOINC PRO_RESPONSE \n_TEXT PRO_RESPONSE\nNUM _ \nPRO_MEASURE_NAME PRO_MEASUR E \n_SEQ PRO_MEASURE \n_SCORE PRO_MEASURE \n_THETA PRO_MEASURE _ \nSCALED_TSCORE PRO_MEASURE _ \nSTANDARD_ERR \nOR PRO_MEASURE_ \nCOUNT_SCORED PRO_MEASUR E \n_LOINC PRO_MEASURE \n_VERSION PRO_ITEM_FULLNAME PRO_ITEM_TEXT PRO_MEASURE_FULLNAME \nExample -PROM IS measure with individual item responses (as text and numeric), as well as the overall measure score (repeated for each field) \n0001 001 100000 PM SleeplOS 61996-5 Very much 5 PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, my sleep was restless \n0002 001 100000 PM Sleep115 619S5-S Not at all \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, I was satisified with my sleep \n0003 001 100000 PM Sleep116 619S6-6 Very much \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, my sleep was refreshing \n0004 001 100000 PM Sleep44 61999-9 Not at all \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, I had difficulty falling asleep \n0005 001 100000 PM Sleep87 61992-4 Never \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, I had trouble staying asleep \n0006 001 100000 PM Sleep90 61993-2 Never \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7days, I had trouble sleeping \n0007 001 100000 PM SleepllO 61988-2 Always \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, I got enough sleep \n0008 001 100000 PM Sleep109 61987-4 Very poor \n PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 123456 20 0.11 51.1 3.7 \n 62197-9 1.0 In the past 7 days, my sleep quality was \nExample -PROM IS measure with a score, but no individual item responses \n0009 001 100010 PM PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Sa 17 O.Sl 5S.1 2.9 \n 1.0 I Example -\"operational\" PRO (PHQ9) that has a score, but no item responses \n0010 001 100001 LC PHQ9 \n 44261-6 I Example -\"operational\" PRO (disability survey) that has individual responses (text and numeric) that are not combined into a summary score Patient Health Questionna ire 9 item \n0012 002 200000 LC 69854-8 Ethnicity \n 11111 69919-9 Are you Hispanic, Latino/a, or of Spanish \norigin?

Populate fields on ly if data are captured in the source system as a discrete \nv\nalue. \n\u2022 Populate records with the RXCUI as it existed at the time the order was entered, even if the RXCUI is no longer active.  Do not attempt to update inactive RXCUIs with a more recent value. \n\u2022 Medications with approved formulations should have an RXCUI that can adequately represent all ingredients with a single code (e.g., SBD, SCD, MIN). For medication mixtures that lack RXCUIs that \nc\nan represent all of the component ingredients (e.g., IV mixtures prepared at an inpatient or compounding pharmacy), each individual medication from the order set should be included as a separate record \nwith a unique PRESCRIBINGID.  If partners wish to preserve the fact that the records belong to the same order, they do so by creating and populating a new optional  ORDERID field.  Medications with a \n1:1 correspondence between the order and RXCUI could have the PRESCRIBINGID stored in the ORDERID.  Orders with a 1:many RXCUI relationship would have different PRESCRIBINGIDs but the \nsame ORDERID. Future versions of the CDM may formalize this guidance. \nPRESCRIBING Table Specification \nField Name RDBMS Data \nType SAS Data Type Predefined Value Sets and \nDescriptive Text for \nCategorical Fields Definition / Comments Data Element \nProvenance Field -level Implementation \nGuidance \nPRESCRIBINGID RDBMS \nText(x) SAS Char(x) .

The DRNOC maintains a list of LOINC \nc\nodes that can be used to represent these observations . The Value Set Appendix contains a list of codes that can be used to map records that were previously stored in the VITAL tabl e.  For \ncompleteness purposes, it contains both preferred and discouraged codes.  Partners should select the code(s) that best represent the data in the ir source systems but should not utilize a code that encodes \nmore information than is available in their data (e.g., do not use a code that specifies a method if the method is unknown).  In general, discouraged codes should not be used. \n\u2022 Decisions on what to include in this table and how to prioritize the population of those records are expected to be driven pr imarily by potential fund ing opportunities. \n\u2022  This table provides a generalized structure for storing observations and is not optimized for analytical efficiency.  As elements from this table are used in studies and /or distributed queries, additional \nr\nepresentations of those data elements (i.e., new table structures) may be required to better support those activities. \n\u2022  If partners are populating pain scores (not pain- related PRO surveys) captured in an inpatient or surgical setting, these values would be expected to be present in this table, not PRO_CM.  \n\u2022  If an observation has a value set that includes an option of \u201cnot documented or assessed\u201d (or similar), these values should be included in the CDM if they are present in the source system.  Do n ot \nde\nrive if an observation is missing. \n\u2022 If a partner has access to vital signs that are sourced from a device feed, they should make an assessment about data volume before including these measures, particularly if multiple readings per day \nar\ne present fo r a large percentage of their population.  Measures should not be averaged or aggregated.  \n\u2022  For healthcare device data sources: If multiple readings are available and the volume of data is judged by the data partner t o be too burdensome for inclusion, using the set of values that were recorded \nd\nirectly in the medical record is preferred over any algorithmic selection process. \n\u2022  For personal device data sources: If multiple readings are available and the volume of data is judged by the data partner to be too h igh for inclusion, the project/study leadership should define a method \nf\nor selecting individual measurements and this logic should be documented in the ETL ADD. \n\u2022  Observations recorded together (e.g., diastolic and systolic blood pressure) should have the sa me date(s) and time(s). \nOBS_CLIN Table Specification \nField Name RDBMS Data \nType SAS Data Type Predefined Value Sets and \nDescriptive Text for Categorical \nFields Definition / Comments Data Element \nProvenance Field -level Implementation \nGuidance \nOBSCLIN ID RDBMS Text(x) SAS Char(x) .

This information can be stored in each partner\u2019s PRIVATE_DEMOGRAPHIC table and PRIVATE_ADDRESS_HISTORY table .  \nT\nhe PII is used as input to the Datavant DeId/tokenization  module.  Tokens should not be placed into the CDM until they have been transformed into Site -PCORnet  transit tokens using the Datavant \nLink /transform-tokens module. \n\u2022  If PII fields are populated with dummy values by default (e.g., 999-99-9999 for phone number or SSN), these values should be removed before running the Datavant DeID/tokenization module.  If PII is \nn\not available within the source system or if local restrictions prevent its use, leave the input field blank . \n\u2022  Tokens are generated based on data availability. If input data is not present for a given token strategy (e.g., combination of PII elements), no token will be generated and an error code will be produced \ni\nnstead.  These token error codes should be loaded into the HASH_TOKEN table (i.e., there should not be any null values).  Do not suppress the error codes in the output of the Datavant software. \n\u2022  Each successfully generated token has a fixed length of 44 characters. Do not enforce a 44 -character constraint, however, to accommodate the error codes generated in the case of tokenization failure. \n\u2022  Tokens should be generated as part of every refresh. Partners can choose to generate tokens for all patients, or only for those patients who were added between refreshes or had updates to their PII . \n\u2022 Select tokens generated using the Datavant DeID /tokenization module are certified as de-identified data via the HIPAA Expert Determination method in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR \npa\nrts 160 and 164). All tokens in the HASH_TOKEN table satisfy this criteria and are controlled via the Datavant DeID  PCORnet configuration settings within the Datavant software . \n\u2022 Additional token strategies are available and can be implemented as needed on a per -study basis based on the study -specific data dictionary . \n\u2022  See the Supplemental Guide on Privacy -Preserving Record Linkage for additional implementation details and guidance (separate document). \n\u2022 Partners that wish to include tokens encrypted using multiple keys for internal purposes should add a TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_ KEY field and store the key name there.  When responding to PCORnet \nque\nries/data curation, the table should be filtered to only include tokens used in PCORnet linkages. The name of this key should also be included in the TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY field in HARVE ST. \n\u2022  Partners should include the TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY string that is output from the Datavant Link software.  Please ensure that this table includes tokens encrypted using the PCORnet key (includes \n\u201cpcornet\u201d or similar in the output string).

Table: LAB_HISTORY \nLAB_HISTORY  Domain Description:   \nTable for  storing historical information about units of measure and \nreference ranges for  laboratory test results.  \nRelational Integrity: \nThe LAB_HISTORY table contains one record per LABHISTORYID. \nPrimary Key: LABHISTORYID \nConstraints: \nLABHISTORYID (unique; required, not null) LAB_LOINC  (required, not null)  \nLAB_HISTORY  Table  Implementation Guidance   \nGuidance  \n\u2022  This  table is  intended to serve as a resource for  partners as they de velop their  extract -transform -load (ETL) procedures to populate LAB_RESULT_CM.  It is designed to  store details related to  units of  \nm\neasure and  normal ranges for  laboratory results that do not  include  such  values at the  record level.   Partners can  use this table as a reference during their ETL  to look up and populate the  relevant  fields  in \nLAB_RESULT_CM for those  records.    \n\u2022  It is expected  t hat partners will  be able to  find information  on units of measure and normal range via reference material maintained by their  clinical labs (electronic documents or online catalogs).   It is not \nnecessary to derive this metadata from individual lab results.  DO NOT DERIVE THESE DATA FROM LOINC RESOURCES.  \n\u2022  While values for  t his table may need to be entered manually, a relatively small n umber of tests (~150)  typically cover the vast majority of testing volume (>85%), which should minimize any data  entry  \nburden.  \n\u2022  Partners may not need to populate this table, particularly if they are already able to meet the network lab data quality metr ics.  \n\u2022  Partners do not need  t o create records in  this table for results that come from external  reference labs (e.g., Quest, LabCorp ).  The DRN OC can provide this  information on request.  \n\u2022  The DRN OC may reference this table if  l abs are needed as part of  a particular study or analysis and  the units and/or reference range is missing from the result(s).  Partners may be asked to populate \nrecords in  this table for th ose  corresponding tests.  \n\u2022  Every record in this table  s hould be unique.  \nhttps://pcornet.org/data/ Page 187 of 210  LABHISTORYID LAB_LOINC LAB_FACILITYID SEX RACE AGE_MIN_WKS AGE_MAX_WKS RESULT_UNIT NORM_RANGE_LOW NORM_MOIOIFIER_LOW NORM_RANGE_HIGH NORM_MODIFIER_HIGH PERIOD_START PERIOD_END RAW_LAB_NAME RAW_UNIT RAW_RANGE \n1 51733-4 1 NS NS 0 4% 85 EQ 97EQ 1/1/15 02 Sat Arterial % 85.00. 97.00 \n2 51733-4 1 NS NS 4 7826% 90 EQ 100 EQ 1/1/15 02 Sat Arterial % 90.00. 100.00\n3 2093-3 2 f NS 0 104.356 mg/dl 44 EQ 181 EQ 1/1/13 12/31/18 Chol mg/dl 44.00-181.00 \n4 2093-3 2 f NS 104.346 7826 mg/dl NO 199 LE 1/1/13 12/31/18 Chol mg/dL <=199.00 \n5 2093-3 2 f NS 0 104.356 mg/dL 40 EQ 186 EQ 1/1/19 Chol mg/dL 40.00-186.00 \n6 2093-3 2 f NS 104.346 7826 mg/dL NO 205 LE 1/1/19 Chol mg/dL <=205.00 I \nFigure 1: Example of populated records for LAB_HISTORY.

It is not necessary to create and populate \nthis table solely for that field. However, partners who are participating in the PCORnet geographic surveillance pilots or those who wish to have their patient populations included in any future geographic \ncharacterizations of PCORnet will need to populate LDS_ADDRESS_HISTORY.  In those situations, there may be a benefit in using PRIVATE_ADDRESS_HISTORY as a local staging table. \n\u2022  Expect multiple records per individual. \n\u2022  This table is currently limited to addresses in the United States. \n\u2022 Partners can limit records in this table to validated addresses if known. \n\u2022  If partners have difficulty constructing a longitudinal address history for patients within their DataMart, they should prioritize populating the current address for each patient. \n\u2022 Geocoded information about the address should be stored in PRIVATE_ADDRESS_GEOCODE. \n\u2022  This tabl e can be kept logically and physically separate from the rest of the CDM.

The website serves as a central hub for information about PCORnet's data resources, quality, security, and privacy measures. It highlights the scale and quality of data accessible through PCORnet, which includes data from over 30 million people annually across the U.S. The data is derived from everyday healthcare encounters and includes electronic health records (EHRs), patient-reported data, and payor data, all standardized into a common format using the PCORnet Common Data Model (CDM). This standardization allows researchers to ask the same question across millions of patients and receive consistent, reliable answers, even from disparate systems. The website provides detailed sections on data sources, data quality, data security, and privacy measures. The data quality section describes a rigorous two-stage screening process to ensure data conformance, completeness, plausibility, and persistence.

29, 2024\n\n1Purpose of this Guide\n\n2Run APIs Live on the Cloud\n\n3NBIA Search REST API URL and Format\n\n4Image Download APIs\n\n5Image Metadata APIs\n\n6Return Values\n\nPurpose of this Guide\n\nThe National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA) REST APIs are provided to access the search and download functions used in the TCIA\u00a0radiology portal.\n\nThe\u00a0NBIA Search REST APIs,\u00a0described on this page, allow you to perform basic queries on and download data for image analysis from public collections.\n\nThe\u00a0NBIA Search with Authentication REST APIs,\u00a0described in the NBIA Search with Authentication REST API Guide, allow you to use the same APIs described on this page to query and download data from restricted collections.\n\nThe NBIA Advanced REST APIs, described in the\u00a0NBIA Advanced REST API Guide, provide advanced features geared towards developers seeking to integrate searching and downloading TCIA data into their own web and desktop applications.\n\nRun APIs Live on the Cloud\n\nYou can find examples for using the NBIA APIs with Python in these Jupyter Notebooks. They are set up so that you can run them in Google Colab without the need to configure your own development environment.\n\nNBIA Search REST API URL and Format\n\nA call includes a base URL followed by the API and query parameters, in that order.\u00a0The base URL to access public data is\u00a0https://services.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-api/services/v1.\n\nBase URL for NLST Data\n\nTo access National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) data, use the following base URL instead: https://nlst.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-api/services/\n\nFor example, in the following URL:\n\nhttps://services.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-api/services/v1/getSeries?Collection=RIDER%20Pilot&PatientID=1.3.6.1.4.1.9328.50.1.0001&StudyInstanceUID=1.3.6.1.4.1.9328.50.1.2&format=csv\n\nThe base URL is\u00a0https://services.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-api/services/v1/.\n\nThe API endpoint is\u00a0getSeries.\n\nThe four query parameters are provided as follows:\u00a0Collection=RIDER Pilot&PatientID=1.3.6.1.4.1.9328.50.1.0001&StudyInstanceUID=1.3.6.1.4.1.9328.50.1.2&format=csv\n\nData can be obtained in the following formats: CSV, HTML, XML, and JSON. \u00a0JSON is the default return format if no format parameter is specified\n\nThe order in which the query parameters are provided does not matter.\n\nNBIA Search REST APIs can only access public data.\u00a0 If you want to use these APIs to access restricted collections, see\u00a0NBIA Search with Authentication REST API Guide.\n\nImage Download APIs\n\nUse the APIs in the following table to download\u00a0images from TCIA.\n\nQuery Name Return Values Output Format Query Parameters Usage Query Name Return Values Output Format Query Parameters Usage getImage An object that represents a set of images in a ZIP file based on SeriesInstanceUID . The naming scheme for the NewFileNames parameter changes from sequential numbers to acquisition number - instance number (in correct order). API example and return values for getImage ZIP SeriesInstanceUID ( R ) NewFileNames ( O ) - Accepted values are Yes and No. Used for bulk transfer of all images in a series. getImageWithMD5Hash All images in the series and MD5 hash values API example and return values for getImageWithMD5Hash ZIP SeriesInstanceUID ( R ) Used for bulk transfer of images with the ability to check MD5Hash. getSingleImage A single DICOM Object that is identified by its SeriesInstanceUID and SOPInstanceUID. This API will always be used following the getSOPInstanceUIDs. API example and return values for\u00a0getSingleImage Raw DICOM Object SeriesInstanceUID ( R ) SOPInstanceUID\u00a0( R ) Used to retrieve a single image.\n\nImage Metadata APIs\n\nUse the APIs in the following table to explore the metadata of objects in the TCIA database. Queries return a file in one of these data formats: CSV, HTML, XML, and JSON. JSON is the default return format if no format parameter is specified.\n\nQuery Name Return Values Query Parameters Query Name Return Values Query Parameters getBodyPartValues Set of all body part names filtered by\u00a0query keys API example and return values for getBodyPartValues Collection ( O ) Modality ( O ) getCollectionValues Set of all collection names API example and return values for getCollectionValues None getContentsByName Return the contents of your cart. To get the name of the cart contents, you must add data to your cart in the TCIA Radiology Portal, and then select Share My Cart . An example of the URL that appears is https://nbia.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-search/?saved-cart=nbia-54241629300063058 . The cart name is what follows the equal sign, so in this example, the cart name is nbia-54241629300063058 . API example and return values for\u00a0getContentsByName name ( R ) getManufacturerValues Set of all manufacturer names filtered by\u00a0query keys API example and return values for getManufacturerValues Collection ( O ) BodyPartExamined ( O ) Modality ( O ) getModalityValues Set of all modality values (CT, MR, ...) filtered by query keys API example and return values for getModalityValues Collection ( O ) BodyPartExamined ( O ) NewPatientsInCollection Set of patients, in a specified collection, since a specified date API example and return values for NewPatientsInCollection Collection ( R ) Date\u00a0( R ) NewStudiesInPatientCollection Set of new studies for given patient and collection since a specified date API example and return values for NewStudiesInPatientCollection Collection ( R ) Date\u00a0( R ) PatientID\u00a0( R ) getPatient Set of patient objects filtered by query keys API example and return values for getPatient Collection ( O ) getPatientByCollectionAndModality Returns a list of PatientIDs, given a specific Collection Name and Modality API example and return values for\u00a0getPatientByCollectionAndModality Collection ( R ) Modality ( R ) getPatientStudy Set of patient/study objects filtered by\u00a0query keys API example and return values for\u00a0getPatientStudy Collection ( R ) PatientID ( O ) StudyInstanceUID ( O ) getSeries Set of series objects filtered by\u00a0query keys API example and return values for\u00a0getSeries Collection ( O ) PatientID ( O ) StudyInstanceUID ( O ) Modality ( O ) SeriesInstanceUID\u00a0( O ) BodyPartExamined\u00a0( O ) ManufacturerModelName\u00a0( O ) Manufacturer\u00a0( O ) SeriesInstanceUID ( O ) getSeriesMetaData All of the metadata for a given SeriesInstanceUID API example and return values for\u00a0getSeriesMetaData SeriesInstanceUID ( R ) getSeriesSize Set of total byte size and object count filtered by\u00a0query key API example and return values for\u00a0getSeriesSize SeriesInstanceUID\u00a0( R ) getSOPInstanceUIDs A list of SOPInstanceUIDs for a given series using the SeriesInstanceUID API example and return values for\u00a0getSOPInstanceUIDs SeriesInstanceUID ( R ) getUpdatedSeries Set of series updated since a specified date API example and return values for getUpdatedSeries fromDate ( R )\n\nReturn Values\n\nThis section lists and explains the return values of the APIs included in both tables above.\n\nIf the value for an attribute is not populated in the specified collection, it will not appear in the returned values.\n\ngetBodyPartValues\n\ngetCollectionValues\n\ngetContentsByName\n\ngetImage\n\ngetImageWithMD5Hash\n\ngetManufacturerValues\n\ngetModalityValues\n\nNewPatientsInCollection\n\nNewStudiesInPatientCollection\n\ngetPatient\n\ngetPatientByCollectionAndModality\n\ngetPatientStudy\n\ngetSeries\n\ngetSeriesMetaData\n\ngetSeriesSize\n\ngetSingleImage\n\ngetSOPInstanceUIDs\n\ngetUpdatedSeries\n\ngetBodyPartValues\n\nSample Call\n\nhttps: //services.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-api/services/v1/getBodyPartValues\n\nAttribute DICOM Tag Description Attribute DICOM Tag Description BodyPartExamined 0018, 0015 Standard DICOM definition\n\nSample Response\n\n\"[ { }, { BodyPartExamined: \"\" ABD PEL \"\" }, { BodyPartExamined: \"\" ABD PELV \"\" }, { BodyPartExamined: \"\" ABDOMEN \"\" }, { BodyPartExamined: \"\" ABDOMENPELVIS \"\" },\"\n\ngetCollectionValues\n\nSample Call\n\nhttps: //services.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-api/services/v1/getCollectionValues\n\nAttribute DICOM Tag Description Attribute DICOM Tag Description Collection N/A A label used to name a set of images collected for a specific trial or other reason.

Programmatic Interface REST API Guides\n\nCreated by      Ashish Sharma, last modified by      Justin Kirby on Sep 12, 2023\n\nThis page describes the representational state transfer application programming interface (REST API) implementations that can be used to access TCIA data and resources. The APIs complement the existing web interfaces and enable developers to build direct access to TCIA data into their applications using only the API documentation provided.\u00a0The application developer must ensure that they and the users of their applications comply with the TCIA Data Usage Policy. If you are interested in using the APIs and have any questions, please contact the TCIA Help Desk except where otherwise noted.\n\nNBIA REST APIs:\u00a0Provided as part of the NBIA software, these APIs provide access to the search and download functions used in the TCIA\u00a0radiology portal, and allow access to both public and limited access DICOM collections. The NBIA Search REST APIs\u00a0allow you to perform basic queries and download data for image analysis on public collections.The NBIA Search with Authentication REST APIs allow you to perform basic queries on and download data for image analysis from public and restricted collections. The NBIA Advanced REST APIs also allow access to public and restricted collections, but are geared towards developers seeking to integrate searching and downloading TCIA data into their own web and desktop applications.\n\nDataCite REST API:\u00a0Each Collection TCIA publishes is issued a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) through DataCite.\u00a0 This API can be used to programmatically access Collection metadata such as their DOIs, titles and abstracts. \u00a0Please note that this API was not developed by TCIA. See https://support.datacite.org/ for any technical questions.\u00a0 The TCIA Helpdesk may be able to assist if your inquiry is related to the content of the data itself.\n\nTCIA REST API: [DEPRECATED 6-22-2022] - The TCIA REST API originally developed using Project Bindaas with Emory University, has been deprecated in favor of the NBIA REST APIs. While the NBIA REST APIs have the same functionality as the Bindaas based TCIA REST APIs, there are some differences that should be noted and tested during conversion from the TCIA REST API to the NBIA REST API. Please see the Migration Guide for details. The existing Bindaas based TCIA REST APIs will remain active but will receive no updates or maintenance going forward.\u00a0 They also do not contain an up-to-date view of our available datasets, so newer collections will not appear if you use them.\n\nTCIA_Utils\n\nThe\u00a0tcia_utils\u00a0package contains functions to simplify common tasks one might perform when interacting with The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) via Python.\u00a0 Issues with this package should be submitted at https://github.com/kirbyju/tcia_utils/issues.\u00a0 Example notebooks demonstrating tcia_utils functionality can be found at\u00a0https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks.\n\nInstallation can be achieved with this Pip command:\n\npip install tcia_utils\n\nTo import functions related to NBIA for accessing our DICOM radiology data:\n\nfrom tcia_utils import nbia\n\nTo import functions related to pathDB for accessing our digitized pathology data:\n\nfrom tcia_utils import pathdb\n\nTo import functions related to Datacite for querying Collection metadata such as their DOIs, titles and abstracts:\n\nfrom tcia_utils import datacite\n\nTCIA Data Usage Policy\n\nAny user accessing TCIA data must agree to:\n\nNot use the requested datasets, either alone or in concert with any other information, to identify or contact individual participants from whom data and/or samples were collected and follow all other conditions specified in our\u00a0Site Disclaimer.\u00a0Approved Users also agree not to generate and use information (e.g., facial images or comparable representations) in a manner that could allow the identities of research participants to be readily ascertained.\u00a0These provisions do not apply to research investigators operating with specific IRB approval, pursuant to 45 CFR 46, to contact individuals within datasets or to obtain and use identifying information under an IRB-approved research protocol. All investigators including any Approved User conducting \u201chuman subjects research\u201d within the scope of 45 CFR 46 must comply with the requirements contained therein.\n\nAcknowledge in all oral or written presentations, disclosures, or publications the specific dataset(s) or applicable accession number(s) and the NIH-designated data repositories through which the investigator accessed any data. Citation guidelines for doing this are outlined below.\n\nIf you are considering mirroring a copy of our publicly available datasets or providing direct access to any of our data via another tool or website using our\u00a0REST API\u00a0please review our\u00a0Data Analysis Centers (DACs) page for more information. DACs must provide attribution and links back to this TCIA data usage policy and require downstream users to do the same.\n\nThe summary page for every TCIA dataset includes a Citations & Data Usage Policy tab (see screenshot below).\u00a0\u00a0Please consult the Citation & Data Usage Policy for each Collection before using them.\n\nMost data are\u00a0freely available to browse, download, and use for commercial, scientific and educational purposes as outlined in the\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License\u00a0or the\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\u00a0 A small number of collections impose Creative Commons licenses with commercial use restrictions, but this is no longer an option for new submissions.\n\nMost data are immediately accessible and do not require account registration.\u00a0 A small subset of collections do require registration and special permission to gain access. Refer to the \"Access\" column on\u00a0https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collections/ for more details.\u00a0Limited Access Collections are currently released under 1 of 2 custom license options:TCIA Restricted License - NOTE: the commercial restriction option is no longer available for new data submissionsnote: The previous TCIA Limited Access License was deprecated 05-19-2022.NCTN Data Archive License (with collaborative agreement; with no collaborative agreement)\n\nTCIA takes every step possible to protect the privacy of participants that have agreed to share their data to promote cancer research. Therefore, effective January 6, 2022, all TCIA Collections of brain, head or head/neck cancers (where data could be used to reconstruct a human face) will change from a Creative Commons license to a TCIA Limited Access License. The data will still be available to download for research, but you will need a TCIA account and an approved License Agreement on file with the TCIA Help Desk.\n\nNo labels\n\nOverview\n\nContent Tools\n\n\u00a9 2014-2020 TCIA \n                                                                |  Site License | Data Usage License & Citation Requirements.\n                                                                | Funded by Frederick Nat.

The TCIA REST APIs allow users to perform basic queries and download data for image analysis from public collections, with advanced features for developers to integrate TCIA data into their applications. The APIs provide access to image download functions, image metadata, and various query parameters to filter and retrieve specific data. The TCIA also issues Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for each collection, accessible via the DataCite REST API. The TCIA data usage policy requires users to agree not to use the data to identify or contact individuals and to acknowledge the specific datasets and repositories in any presentations or publications. Most data are freely available under Creative Commons licenses, with some collections requiring registration and special permission. The TCIA takes measures to protect participant privacy, especially for collections involving brain, head, or head/neck cancers. Overall, TCIA is a valuable resource for researchers seeking access to a wide range of cancer imaging data and related tools for analysis and integration into their research workflows.\"}",

Users can upload their own data to the secure cloud environment for comparative analysis with NCI-funded datasets.\n\nThrough the CRs, users have access to thousands of publicly available tools \u2013 analytical applications and workflows \u2013 that can be tailored for specific projects. Additionally, users can bring their own proprietary tools to their secure cloud workspace.\n\nEach of the NCI-funded cloud resources has unique capabilities. Broad Institute FireCloud (FC) Focused on running production pipelines Based on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) ISB Cancer Gateway in the Cloud (ISB-CGC) Focused on Command-line savvy users, Big Query, and Specialty Databases Based on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud, powered by Velsera (SB-CGC) Focused on non-technical users with interface & visual displays Based on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform\n\nCloud Resources Make Data Sets Accessible\n\nThe CRDC CRs make data from various programs and initiatives accessible. Below is an outline of the most used datasets and where they can be found.\n\nData Commons Datasets FC ISB SB GDC TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments) PDC CPTAC (Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium) APOLLO (applied Proteomics Organizational Learning and Outcomes) ICPC (International Cancer Proteogenomic Consortium) CBTN (Children\u2019s Brain Tumor Network) ICDC CMPC (The Comparative Molecular Characterization Program) COP (Comparative Oncology Program) PCCR The Purdue University Center for Cancer Research) CDS PPTC (Pediatric Preclinical Testing consortium) HTAN (Human Tumor Atlas Network) CCDI (Childhood Cancer Data Initiative) IDC TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)\n\nNote that these are the most commonly requested datasets from each Data Commons and the Cloud Resource that provides access.\n\nLearn more about Select Datasets and how to access them.\n\nUsers can also go to each Data Commons for a complete list of the datasets they house.\n\nLearn more about\n\nAnalyze\n\nAnalytical Tools and Features\n\nSupport for Researchers",

contact us at our helpdesk.\n\nAPI roadmap\u00b6\n\nOur API will be undergoing large structural changes in the spring/summer, and we highly recommend delaying any serious development against it until we release the new version. However, if you are interested in working with our API, we would love to hear from you, especially as we work out what capabilities we will offer. We would be happy to work with you during our development, and to bring your group on as beta testers when we get closer to release.\n\nquerygetReturns all column names and definitions for schemapostExecute Subject querypostExecute Subject Files querypostExecute Subjects Counts querypostExecute Subjects File Counts querypostExecute Research Subject querypostExecute ResearchSubject Files querypostExecute ResearchSubjects Counts querypostExecute ResearchSubjects File Counts querypostExecute Specimens querypostExecute Specimen Files querypostExecute Specimen Counts querypostExecute Specimen File Counts querypostExecute Diagnosis querypostExecute Diagnosis Counts querypostExecute Mutation querypostExecute Mutation Counts querypostExecute Treatments querypostExecute Treatments Counts querypostReturns all unique valuespostReturns counts of the DCSpostReturns a list of files given a boolean querypostExecute File Counts querymetagetCDA statusgetDescription of latest datasetgetList descriptions of all available datasetsAPI docs by RedoclyCDA API (3.2.0)Download OpenAPI specification:Download  License: Apache 2.0 API definition for the CDA\nqueryRetrieve the data stored in the CDA.\nReturns all column names and definitions for schema Return columnNames for schema along with their descriptions\nResponses200 columns response\nget/api/v1/columnshttps://cancerdata.dsde-prod.broadinstitute.org/api/v1/columns Response samples 200Content typeapplication/jsonCopy Expand all  Collapse all {\"result\": [{ }]}Execute Subject query Execute a Subject query composed of conditions on columns combined with boolean operators.

The primary purpose of the Clinical and Translational Data Commons (CTDC) page is to facilitate cancer research and improve cancer outcomes by offering tools for data exploration, analysis, and harmonization. The website is structured to provide users with various functionalities, including exploring data, analyzing data, and accessing support resources. Key sections of the site include an overview of CTDC, data types available for analysis, and detailed information on specific datasets such as the Cancer Moonshot Biobank, which is set for its first release in Fall 2024. The site also includes a header with navigation links and a search bar, and a footer with additional links and policies such as accessibility and disclaimer policies. The CTDC page offers links to various sections, including the CBIIT home page, support resources, staff login, and detailed information on the Cancer Moonshot Biobank. Users can explore data through the 'Explore Data' section and utilize analytical tools in the 'Analyze Data' section. The data types available for analysis include clinical data and reports (in txt and pdf formats) and molecular findings and sequence annotations (in vcf and bam formats). The website also provides access to three NCI-funded Cloud Resources (CRs) - Broad Institute FireCloud (FC), ISB Cancer Gateway in the Cloud (ISB-CGC), and Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (SB-CGC) - each with distinct capabilities for data access and analysis. These cloud resources allow researchers to use secure workspaces for individual or collaborative exploration and analysis, leveraging the cloud's elastic compute capabilities and a wide range of analytical tools. Users can upload their own data to the secure cloud environment for comparative analysis with NCI-funded datasets. The CRs provide access to thousands of publicly available tools, including analytical applications and workflows, and users can also bring their proprietary tools to their secure cloud workspace. The website outlines the most commonly requested datasets from each Data Commons and the Cloud Resource that provides access, including TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments), PDC, CPTAC (Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium), APOLLO (Applied Proteomics Organizational Learning and Outcomes), ICPC (International Cancer Proteogenomic Consortium), CBTN (Children\u2019s Brain Tumor Network), ICDC, CMPC (The Comparative Molecular Characterization Program), COP (Comparative Oncology Program), PCCR (The Purdue University Center for Cancer Research), CDS, PPTC (Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium), HTAN (Human Tumor Atlas Network), and CCDI (Childhood Cancer Data Initiative). The website also provides detailed API documentation, including endpoints for querying various types of data such as subjects, files, research subjects, specimens, diagnoses, mutations, and treatments. Users can execute queries to retrieve data, count data entries, and fetch specific data files. The API documentation includes information on query parameters, request body schemas, and response samples, providing a comprehensive guide for developers and researchers to interact with the data programmatically. Overall, the CBIIT website is a robust resource for cancer researchers, offering extensive data access, analytical tools, and support for advancing cancer research and improving cancer outcomes.\"}",

            "openapi_spec": "https://service.azul.data.humancellatlas.org/:\n\n        azul-service-prod 9.0 OAS3\n\n/openapi\n\nOverview\n\nAzul is a REST web service for querying metadata associated with\nboth experimental and analysis data from a data repository. In order\nto deliver response times that make it suitable for interactive use\ncases, the set of metadata properties that it exposes for sorting,\nfiltering, and aggregation is limited. Azul provides a uniform view\nof the metadata over a range of diverse schemas, effectively\nshielding clients from changes in the schemas as they occur over\ntime. It does so, however, at the expense of detail in the set of\nmetadata properties it exposes and in the accuracy with which it\naggregates them.\n\nAzul denormalizes and aggregates metadata into several different\nindices for selected entity types. Metadata entities can be queried\nusing the Index endpoints.\n\nA set of indices forms a catalog. There is a default catalog called\ndcp38 which will be used unless a\ndifferent catalog name is specified using the catalog query\nparameter. Metadata from different catalogs is completely\nindependent: a response obtained by querying one catalog does not\nnecessarily correlate to a response obtained by querying another\none. Two catalogs can contain metadata from the same sources or\ndifferent sources. It is only guaranteed that the body of a\nresponse by any given endpoint adheres to one schema,\nindependently of which catalog was specified in the request.\n\nAzul provides the ability to download data and metadata via the\nManifests endpoints. The\ncurl format manifests can be used to\ndownload data files. Other formats provide various views of the\nmetadata. Manifests can be generated for a selection of files using\nfilters. These filters are interchangeable with the filters used by\nthe Index endpoints.\n\nAzul also provides a summary\nview of indexed data.\n\nData model\n\nAny index, when queried, returns a JSON array of hits. Each hit\nrepresents a metadata entity. Nested in each hit is a summary of the\nproperties of entities associated with the hit. An entity is\nassociated either by a direct edge in the original metadata graph,\nor indirectly as a series of edges. The nested properties are\ngrouped by the type of the associated entity. The properties of all\ndata files associated with a particular sample, for example, are\nlisted under hits[*].files in a /index/samples response. It is\nimportant to note that while each hit represents a discrete\nentity, the properties nested within that hit are the result of an\naggregation over potentially many associated entities.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider a data file that is part of two\nprojects (a project is a group of related experiments, typically by\none laboratory, institution or consortium). Querying the files\nindex for this file yields a hit looking something like:\n\nThis example hit contains two kinds of nested entities (a hit in an\nactual Azul response will contain more): There are the two projects\nentities, and the file itself. These nested entities contain\nselected metadata properties extracted in a consistent way. This\nmakes filtering and sorting simple.\n\nAlso notice that there is only one file. When querying a particular\nindex, the corresponding entity will always be a singleton like\nthis.\n\nServers\n\nAuthorize\n\nIndexQuery the indices for entities of interest GET/index/catalogsList all available catalogs.GET/index/{entity_type}/{entity_id}Detailed information on a particular entity.HEAD/index/{entity_type}Perform a query without returning its result.POST/index/{entity_type}\nSearch an index for entities of interest\n, with filters provided in the request body.\nGET/index/{entity_type}\nSearch an index for entities of interest\n.\nHEAD/index/summaryPerform a query without returning its result.GET/index/summaryStatistics on the data present across all entities.\n\nManifestsComplete listing of files matching a given filter in TSV and\nother formats PUT/manifest/filesInitiate the preparation of a manifestGET/manifest/files/{token}Determine status of a manifest preparation jobPUT/fetch/manifest/filesInitiate the preparation of a manifest via XHRGET/fetch/manifest/files/{token}Determine status of a manifest preparation job via XHR\n\nRepositoryAccess to data files in the underlying repository GET/repository/files/{file_uuid}Redirect to a URL for downloading a given data file from the underlying repositoryGET/fetch/repository/files/{file_uuid}Request a URL for downloading a given data fileGET/repository/sourcesList available data sources\n\nAuxiliaryDescribes various aspects of the Azul service GET/openapiReturn OpenAPI specifications for this REST APIGET/healthComplete health checkGET/health/basicBasic health checkGET/health/cachedCached health check for continuous monitoringGET/health/fastFast health checkGET/health/{keys}Selective health checkGET/versionDescribe current version of this REST API"

        "summary": "{\"reasoning\": \"The summary should include detailed information about the purpose of the Human Cell Atlas Data Portal, the types of data available, and the functionalities provided by the portal. This will help users determine if this data source is appropriate for their specific data needs.\",\n \"summary\": \"The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) Data Portal is a comprehensive resource designed to provide access to datasets and resources related to the Human Cell Atlas project. This community-generated, multi-omic, open data project aims to map and characterize all human cells. The portal allows users to explore, contribute, and stay updated on the latest data and developments in the field of human cell research. The main functionalities of the HCA Data Portal include navigating to the portal, accessing datasets, exploring HCA BioNetworks, viewing guides, accessing metadata, contributing data, accessing APIs, viewing updates, searching the portal, and joining the HCA community. The portal also provides links to social media platforms such as GitHub, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn for community engagement and updates. Additionally, users can find information about the HCA project, get help, view the privacy policy, and contact the HCA team through the portal. The portal's main sections include a header with navigation links and a search button, a main section with options to explore or contribute data, statistics on cells, donors, projects, and labs, HCA Biological Network Atlases with various categories (e.g., Adipose, Breast, Development, etc.), and a footer with additional links (About, Help, Privacy, Contact, Social Media). The portal provides detailed guides on how to access and use the data, including quick start guides, exploring projects, accessing HCA data and metadata, exporting HCA data to Terra, exploring project matrices, and accessing metadata via TDR. Users can find and download cross-project data and associated metadata using the Data Browser and curl commands. The portal also offers an interactive Data Explorer to design unique cohorts or data subsets by selecting various facets in the Data Explorer's Filters. Users can download raw data, analysis files, and metadata by clicking the Export button, which provides options to download study data and metadata via curl commands, download a file manifest with metadata for the selected data, or export study data and metadata to a Terra Workspace. The metadata, also called a 'Data Manifest,' is in TSV file format and lists all the details about the selected data, such as donor information and disease-state. The portal also provides access to the Azul REST web service for querying metadata associated with both experimental and analysis data from a data repository. Azul provides a uniform view of the metadata over a range of diverse schemas, effectively shielding clients from changes in the schemas as they occur over time. Users can query the indices for entities of interest, list all available catalogs, and access detailed information on particular entities. The portal also offers the ability to download data and metadata via the Manifests endpoints, with various views of the metadata available.
